# Dashboard App Build â€” Status Snapshot

## SEO Route
- âœ… Mock-backed `/seo` Remix route renders Polaris UI with filters, insight/action lists, keyword/page tables, credential banner, and CSV exports.
- âœ… Shared types/mocks/aggregator implemented under `dashboard/app/{types,mocks,lib}/seo`.
- ðŸ”„ Live adapter wiring pending OAuth design, caching, and telemetry strategy (see inline TODOs).
- ðŸ”„ Add automated tests (Vitest/RTL/Playwright) once testing harness configured.

## Next Actions
1. Finalize OAuth + credential storage plan (Settings route & secrets helper).
2. Implement caching + background refresh for SEO aggregation before enabling live data.
3. Extend testing harness with unit & integration coverage per `prompts/dashboard/testing.md`.
4. Roll status into main program board once remaining SEO TODOs complete.
