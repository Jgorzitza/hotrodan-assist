# Post-Deploy Smoke Checklist

Run after each staging or production deployment. Owners: QA (primary) + on-call engineer.

## Pre-Checks
- Confirm deploy timestamp in release notes and CI run URL.
- Ensure feature flags match target environment (no residual staging toggles in prod).

## Functional Smoke
- Login via Shopify OAuth â†’ land on overview dashboard without console errors.
- Overview metrics refresh timestamp < 5 min; cards show non-zero data.
- Orders route loads first page; trigger CSV export and confirm status tile appears.
- Inventory route low-stock filter returns at least one row; bulk adjust flow produces toast.
- Settings route rotates webhook secret; new secret stored and previous revoked.

## Webhook & Jobs
- Replay `orders/updated` via `scripts/shopify_webhook_replay.sh`.
- Check worker logs for matching job id and `completed` status.
- Verify Prisma `webhook_events` table entry appended with current timestamp.

## Observability
- Confirm Datadog/NewRelic dashboard shows new deploy marker.
- Check error tracker (Sentry/etc.) for new alerts during smoke window.

## Rollback Readiness
- Validate previous release remains available (feature flag or backup environment).
- Document outstanding issues and assign follow-ups before closing release ticket.
