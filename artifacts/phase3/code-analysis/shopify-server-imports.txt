## Build Warning Analysis

Build output warning:
> "The following modules are referenced both dynamically and statically"

**Root cause**: 
- Static imports in multiple route loaders/actions
- Possible dynamic import() calls in Remix route splitting
- Vite/Remix treats route modules as dynamic chunks by default

## Typical Import Patterns Found

```typescript
// entry.server.tsx (line 9)
import { addDocumentResponseHeaders } from "./shopify.server";

// routes/app.tsx (line 8)
import { authenticate } from "../shopify.server";
```

**Assessment**: All imports appear to be static ESM imports.
**Hypothesis**: Warning is false positive OR caused by Remix's automatic route-based code splitting treating routes as dynamic boundaries.

## Recommendation

**Priority**: MEDIUM (was HIGH, downgraded after analysis)
**Action**: This is likely a Remix/Vite code-splitting artifact, not a real duplication issue.
**Validation**: Check final bundle sizes - if duplication were severe, shopify.server.ts would appear in multiple chunks with significant size impact.

From build output:
- PolarisVizProvider: 226 kB (largest)
- shopify.server.ts impact: Not among top chunks (suggests minimal duplication)

**Conclusion**: Warning noted but not critical. No immediate action required.
