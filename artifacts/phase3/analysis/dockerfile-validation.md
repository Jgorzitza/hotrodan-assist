# Dockerfile Validation — 2025-10-01 08:18 UTC

## Analysis Summary

**File**: `dashboard/Dockerfile`  
**Issue**: ⚠️ **Duplicate multi-stage builds detected**

## Problems Identified

### 1. Duplicate Base Stages
File contains **TWO separate multi-stage build definitions**:

#### Build 1 (lines 1-20): Alpine-based
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
FROM deps AS build
FROM node:20-alpine AS runtime
```

#### Build 2 (lines 22-49): Bullseye-based
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-bullseye AS base
FROM base AS deps
FROM deps AS build
FROM deps AS prod-deps
FROM base AS runtime
```

**Problem**: Both use same stage names (deps, build, runtime), creating ambiguity.

### 2. Missing Prisma Migrations
Alpine build (line 10):
```dockerfile
RUN npm run prisma:generate || true
```

**Issue**: Silent failure (`|| true`) could mask Prisma generation errors.

Bullseye build: No Prisma generation in build stage at all.

### 3. Inconsistent Ports
- Alpine: EXPOSE 3000
- Bullseye: EXPOSE 8080, ENV PORT=8080

### 4. Production Dependencies
Alpine: Includes full node_modules (dev dependencies)  
Bullseye: Proper `npm prune --omit=dev` (correct)

## Recommendations

### CRITICAL (Blocking Production)
1. **Remove duplicate definitions** — keep ONE multi-stage build
2. **Fix Prisma generation** — remove `|| true` fallback, ensure generation succeeds
3. **Consistent port configuration** — standardize on 8080 or 3000
4. **Prune dev dependencies** — ensure production image excludes dev packages

### Suggested Corrected Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev

FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run prisma:generate
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-alpine AS runtime
ENV NODE_ENV=production
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/build ./build
COPY --from=build /app/prisma ./prisma
COPY --from=build /app/package.json ./
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "./build/server/index.js"]
```

## Verdict

❌ **Dockerfile is NOT production-ready**
- Duplicate build stages (ambiguous)
- Silent Prisma generation failures
- Inconsistent configuration
- Dev dependencies included in Alpine build

**Action**: Assign to Tooling agent for immediate fix.
