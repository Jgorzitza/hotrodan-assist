  answer: |
    For EFI systems, use a ≤10 μm (ten micron) pressure-side filter after the pump and before the rails/injectors.
    If your pump lacks an in-tank sock (external/inline pump), add a coarse 40-100 μm pre-filter on the inlet.
    Use PTFE-lined AN hose for compatibility with gasoline, diesel, E85, methanol, and other fuels, and for long-term permeation resistance.
    Line sizing: AN-6 to ~500 hp; AN-8 for ~500-800 hp or added headroom; AN-10 for higher flow or long runs.

  patterns:
    - "returnless"
    - "return.*style"
    - "corvette regulator"
    - "filter/regulator"
  answer: |
    Return-style is the most forgiving for swaps: feed line to rails, bypass regulator near the rail, and a return line back to the tank.
    Returnless uses an in-rail or "Corvette-style" filter/regulator (~58 psi) near the tank: short return at the regulator, single feed forward.
    If uncertain, choose return-style with a quality in-tank pump module; it’s easier to tune across injectors, fuels, and future upgrades.
    Always include ≤10 μm pressure-side filtration and PTFE-lined hose (gasoline, diesel, E85, methanol, etc.).

  answer: |
    Tru-Cool MAX 40K (LPD4739) is a stacked-plate auxiliary transmission cooler that roughly doubles the heat rejection of the Tru-Cool LPD line. Brazed aluminum construction and tightly spaced fins keep ATF in airflow, and the built-in cold-weather passive bypass routes thick, cold fluid around the core until it warms up.
    Ports are 5/8-18 inverted flare; adapt them to AN with metric-to-AN fittings for clean PTFE hose plumbing. Hardware is included; mount in direct airflow below the radiator fill line and pair with quality filtration to protect the transmission.

  answer: |
    Vapor Trapper (TM) is a billet, serviceable charcoal canister that installs in-line on a fuel tank vent to stop garage and cabin fuel odor while letting the tank breathe. Universal models (4/6/8" canisters) ship with -6 ORB ports; the High Performance variants add -8 AN end caps for higher-flow builds and AN plumbing.
    Mount the canister above the tank with two 2-1/2" clamps, run PTFE AN hose from the sending-unit vent, and replace the charcoal media when saturated. Pair it with the matching rollover valve (-6 AN for universal, -8 AN for high performance) to block fuel spill if the vehicle inverts.

  answer: |
    The Walbro/Ti Automotive GSL392 is a 255 LPH external EFI pump that supports common LS swaps and retrofit EFI systems targeting ~60 psi base pressure. It uses 10 mm x 1.0 inlet/outlet ports; adapt them to AN-6 or AN-8 for PTFE hose, mount low near the tank with isolated clamps, and protect it with a 40-100 μm pre-filter plus a ≤10 μm post-filter.
    After plumbing, prime the system, verify pressure at the rails, and monitor duty cycle if you step up to boosted or E85 power levels.
