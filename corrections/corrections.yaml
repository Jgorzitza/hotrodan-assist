  answer: |
    For EFI systems, use a ≤10 μm (ten micron) pressure-side filter after the pump and before the rails/injectors.
    If your pump lacks an in-tank sock (external/inline pump), add a coarse 40–100 μm pre-filter on the inlet.
    Use PTFE-lined AN hose for compatibility with gasoline, diesel, E85, methanol, and other fuels, and for long-term permeation resistance.
    Line sizing: AN-6 to ~500 hp; AN-8 for ~500–800 hp or added headroom; AN-10 for higher flow or long runs.

  answer: |
    Return-style is the most forgiving for swaps: feed line to rails, bypass regulator near the rail, and a return line back to the tank.
    Returnless uses an in-rail or “Corvette-style” filter/regulator (~58 psi) near the tank: short return at the regulator, single feed forward.
    If uncertain, choose return-style with a quality in-tank pump module; it’s easier to tune across injectors, fuels, and future upgrades.
    Always include ≤10 μm pressure-side filtration and PTFE-lined hose (gasoline, diesel, E85, methanol, etc.).

  answer: |
    Most GM EFI feeds are 3/8" OD—adapt them to AN-6 for typical builds and step to AN-8 if you need extra headroom above ~500–600 hp. Returns are usually 5/16"; adapt those to AN-6.
    Hot Rod AN’s Corvette-style filter/regulator already has AN-6 male ports, so you can skip quick-connect adapters when you mount it near the tank.
    When you do need adapters, use the threaded lock-nut design: click the fitting into the GM socket, snug the lock-nut so it clamps the tube lip, and perform a tug test. Lubricate the small O-rings with clean oil before install so they seat without damage.
    Always verify connector sizes with a caliper (≈9.5 mm feed, ≈8.0 mm return) and finish the system with a ≤10 μm post-pump filter for EFI.
