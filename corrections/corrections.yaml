  answer: |
    For EFI systems, use a ≤10 μm (ten micron) pressure-side filter after the pump and before the rails/injectors.
    If your pump lacks an in-tank sock (external/inline pump), add a coarse 40–100 μm pre-filter on the inlet.
    Use PTFE-lined AN hose for compatibility with gasoline, diesel, E85, methanol, and other fuels, and for long-term permeation resistance.
    Line sizing: AN-6 to ~500 hp; AN-8 for ~500–800 hp or added headroom; AN-10 for higher flow or long runs.

- id: return-vs-returnless-basics
  patterns:
    - "returnless"
    - "return.*style"
    - "corvette regulator"
    - "filter/regulator"
  answer: |
    Return-style is the most forgiving for swaps: feed line to rails, bypass regulator near the rail, and a return line back to the tank.
    Returnless uses an in-rail or “Corvette-style” filter/regulator (~58 psi) near the tank: short return at the regulator, single feed forward.
    If uncertain, choose return-style with a quality in-tank pump module; it’s easier to tune across injectors, fuels, and future upgrades.
    Always include ≤10 μm pressure-side filtration and PTFE-lined hose (gasoline, diesel, E85, methanol, etc.).
