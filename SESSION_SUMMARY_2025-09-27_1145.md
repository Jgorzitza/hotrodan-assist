# Session Summary — Program Manager Sweep

## What we did
- Reviewed dashboard Orders, Sales, Inbox, and Data-layer prompts; confirmed status/immediate focus sections remain accurate after the 2025-09-26 updates.
- Checked coordination memos (`coordination/2025-09-26_prisma-config-plan.md`, `coordination/2025-09-27_orders-sync-contract.md`) for open items; no new actions required beyond tracking Sync write API go-live.
- Validated `SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-09-26_1052.md` still represented the baseline, then ran two discover → incremental ingest loops (87 updates + 80 updates, 0 deletes via FastEmbed) and confirmed `run_goldens.py` stays green after each 2025-09-27 sitemap delta.

- Dashboard feature branches (`feature/route-orders`, `feature/route-sales-drilldown`, `feature/route-inbox`) remain aligned with their prompts; Sync has frozen the write payload schema so Orders can now flip to live endpoints, while Sales continues to defer the Polaris Viz upgrade until after MVP per the alignment memo.
- Coordination docs remain active: Prisma config plan awaiting post-merge CI smoke, Orders ↔ Sync contract awaiting write API payload finalization.
- RAG stack refreshed 2025-09-27 14:13 MDT (FastEmbed fallback; 87 + 80 updated docs, goldens 2/2 pass after each run).

## Immediate focus
1) Relaunch Orders to wire the live Sync write APIs and extend Vitest coverage (`coordination/2025-09-27_orders-sync-contract.md`).
2) Partner with Data-layer/Sales on publishing the live analytics contract while keeping Polaris Viz/background export work on ice until post-MVP.
3) Monitor Shopify sitemap timestamps after the 2025-09-27 refresh and rerun discover → ingest → goldens on the next delta or 24h sweep.

## Follow-ups
1) Ping DevOps after feature merges to capture the outstanding Prisma CLI CI smoke in `coordination/2025-09-26_prisma-config-plan.md`.
2) Confirm with Sync whether returns/inventory write payloads changed before Orders Vitest coverage expands.
3) Revisit dashboard prompt statuses after the analytics contract is published or if Sync timelines slip ahead of the next daily sweep.
