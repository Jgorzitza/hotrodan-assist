# Security Test Strategy

## Objectives
Ensure the approvals service meets security standards ahead of production deployment.

## Areas of Focus
- Authentication & Authorization (post-implementation)
- Input validation & sanitization
- Transport security
- Audit log integrity
- Secrets management

## Activities
1. **Static Analysis**: Run Bandit and safety checks on dependencies.
2. **Dependency Audit**: Pin versions, scan for CVEs (pip-audit).
3. **Penetration Testing**: OWASP ZAP scans; manual testing for injection/XSS.
4. **Access Control Tests**: Validate RBAC rules once implemented.
5. **Audit Trail Verification**: Ensure append-only, tamper detection.

## Schedule
- Perform baseline security testing before each release.
- Trigger additional scans after significant code changes.

## Deliverables
- Security test reports.
- Remediation plan for findings.

Prepared during overnight documentation sprint.
