# Disaster Recovery Plan

_Last updated: 2025-09-29_

## Scenarios Covered
- Data corruption or loss
- Infrastructure outage
- Catastrophic deployment failure

## Objectives
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): < 4 hours
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): < 1 hour

## DR Strategy
1. **Backups**: Implement backup strategy (see backup-strategy.md).
2. **Secondary Environment**: Maintain warm standby environment (staging) ready for promotion.
3. **Runbooks**:
   - Initiate incident response.
   - Restore backups in standby environment.
   - Update DNS/load balancer to route traffic to standby.

## Steps
1. Detect incident via monitoring alerts.
2. Declare incident; assemble response team.
3. Assess damage (data integrity, service availability).
4. If primary unavailable, promote standby environment:
   - Restore latest backup.
   - Reconfigure integrations (assistants, connectors) to point to standby.
5. Validate service functionality (smoke tests).
6. Communicate status to stakeholders.
7. After resolving root cause, plan failback to primary.

## Testing
- Schedule DR drills quarterly.
- Document lessons learned and update runbooks.

## Communication Plan
- Incident commander coordinates updates via designated channel.
- Stakeholders alerted via email/SMS as per incident policy.

Prepared during overnight documentation sprint.
