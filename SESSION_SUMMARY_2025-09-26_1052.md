# Session Summary

## What we did
- Reconciled dashboard route prompts (sales + orders) with the latest implementation, marking tasks complete and refreshing immediate focus.
- Verified the `dashboard` workspace lint (`npm run lint`) passes after recent TypeScript cleanup.
- Captured cross-team next steps in program-manager status notes so Orders/Sales agents can coordinate with Sync, data-layer, and Polaris Viz owners.

## Current state
- On branch `feature/route-sales-drilldown` with all Section 0 dashboard routes checked in.
- Shared date-range helper drives `/app`, `/app/sales`, and `/app/orders`; SSE bridge for inbox + sync stubs ready behind feature flags.
- `npm run lint` from `dashboard/` passes; Vitest suites last ran on previous dashboard handoff (refresh pending once live adapters land).
- Shopify CLI/dev server not launched this session; credentials + tunnel setup still tracked in route prompts.

## Immediate focus
1) Coordinate with Sync on write API enablement so the Orders optimistic flows can run end-to-end (log in `coordination/2025-09-27_orders-sync-contract.md`).
2) Prepare the Sales route for the Polaris Viz package upgrade + background export design while keeping mocks deterministic.
3) Plan the next dashboard QA pass (screenshots, smoke run) once credentials and dev server are ready.

## RAG status
- Refined sitemap discovery to auto-detect gzip-compressed XML, guard against recursive sitemap loops, and expose CLI overrides for base URL, proxy usage, timeouts, and output paths.
- `python discover_urls.py` still fails with `[Errno 101] Network is unreachable` despite proxy bypass attempts, so cached URL lists remain authoritative until outbound access is restored.
- Offline goldens (corrections-only) re-ran 2025-09-27 and still pass; retrieval spot check remains pending the next successful ingest.

## Follow-ups
1) Expand `corrections/corrections.yaml` beyond the current EFI micron/returnless coverage (target dual-tank, surge, and vapor management FAQs).
2) Add matching golden cases for each new correction so regressions surface offline.
3) Monitor Shopify sitemap timestamps; rerun `discover_urls.py` + incremental ingest when a post-2025-09-26 delta appears.
