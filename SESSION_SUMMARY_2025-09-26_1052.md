# Session Summary

## What we did
- Wired up Shopify CLI; dev preview is running.
- Clarified webhook testing flow; localhost vs https tunnel.
- Decided to keep Codex brief in `prompts/` inside app root.
- Introduced app scaffolding for embedded Remix “Dashboard”.

## Current state
- On branch `feature/dashboard-setup`.
- New untracked app files present (dashboard/, prompts/, shopify.app.toml, package.json, etc.).
- Receiver on :3000 not running yet (curl failed) — next to start it and re-trigger webhook.

## Next steps (short list)
1) Start webhook receiver on `http://localhost:3000` and re-test with `shopify app webhook trigger`.
2) Commit UI route skeletons with mock loaders for `/`, `/sales`, `/orders`, `/inbox`, `/inventory`, `/seo`.
3) Freeze contracts under `app/lib/contracts/*` to let adapters proceed in parallel.
