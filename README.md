# Hot Rod AN â€” RAG + Omnichannel Assistants

Start here: read `HANDOVER.md` for the full specs, milestones, and service layout. See `agents.md` for the condensed agent playbook.

## Quickstart (local)
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -U llama-index openai "chromadb>=0.5" \
               llama-index-vector-stores-chroma llama-index-readers-web \
               llama-index-readers-file pyyaml \
               llama-index-embeddings-fastembed fastembed
cp .env.example .env
python discover_urls.py
python ingest_site_chroma.py
python query_chroma_router.py "EFI swap ~400 hp; pump LPH, 10 micron, AN sizes?"
```

- Populate `.env` with service credentials (OpenAI, Zoho, Shopify). `SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `SHOPIFY_SHOP` must be filled before running the sync service.
- If you leave `OPENAI_API_KEY` empty, the stack now falls back to FastEmbed embeddings and returns retrieval-only bullets from the `/query` endpoint; add a real key to restore full generative answers.
- Shopify CLI users can run `shopify app config use shopify.app.toml` followed by `shopify app deploy` to apply config, then `shopify app webhook trigger orders/create` to send signed test events to `http://localhost:8003/shopify/webhook`.

## Tests
```
# Python RAG regression suite
python run_goldens.py  # offline corrections-only; no API calls

# Remix dashboard checks (run from repo root)
npm run lint
npm test -- --run
npm run test:e2e -- --list
```

- When the virtual environment is not active, prefix commands with `.venv/bin/` (e.g., `./.venv/bin/python run_goldens.py`).
- Install JS deps with `npm install` before running the dashboard test commands. Playwright browsers are installed automatically in CI; locally run `npx playwright install --with-deps` once.

## Repo highlights
- Retrieval stack: LlamaIndex + Chroma scripts in repo root (`discover_urls.py`, `ingest_site_chroma.py`, `query_chroma_router.py`).
- Advanced document pipeline lives under `rag_pipeline/` powering dedupe, TOC-aware splitting, and semantic chunking for all ingest flows.
- Quality guardrails: `corrections/corrections.yaml`, `goldens/qa.yaml`, `run_goldens.py`.
- Service stubs: FastAPI apps under `app/` (rag-api, assistants, sync, approval-app).
- Specs & docs: `HANDOVER.md`, `HANDOVER_ALL_IN_ONE.md`, and `agents.md`.

## Dashboard Remix App
The Shopify Admin dashboard lives under `dashboard/` and was scaffolded from the official Remix template.

```
cd dashboard
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Authenticate the CLI interactively before running the next command
shopify app config link
shopify app dev --store=afafsaf.myshopify.com
```

- Update `.env` / `.env.production` with Partner app credentials, tunnel URL, and `DATABASE_URL`.
- Switch stores by running `shopify app dev --store=fm8vte-ex.myshopify.com` once live-ready.
- Section 0 status, route briefs, data layer, and integration plans live in `prompts/dashboard/`.
- All Remix routes currently render Polaris UIs backed by mock data (`USE_MOCK_DATA=true`). Swap to live data by wiring the modules in `dashboard/app/lib/`.
- Set `ENABLE_MCP=true` after wiring real Storefront MCP credentials (`MCP_API_URL`, `MCP_API_KEY`) and validate via upcoming settings toggle.
- Service registry: app/service_registry polls health and versions across services.

### Additional Modules
- Idempotency: `app/idempotency` provides file-based idempotency keys and handlers.
- Security: `app/security` manages OAuth secret rotation and lifecycle.
- Resilience: `app/resilience` implements rate limiting and circuit breakers.
- Observability: `app/observability` provides simple OpenTelemetry-style correlation.
- Contract Tests: `app/contract_tests` validates mocks against registered contracts.
- Replay: `app/replay` enables backfill and event replay with guardrails.
- Deployment: `app/deployment` supports canary deploys and traffic shifting.
