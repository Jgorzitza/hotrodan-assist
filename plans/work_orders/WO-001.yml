title: Repo bootstrap: CI, test runner, RPG scaffold
owner: builder-agent
nodes_targeted:
  - mod.infra.ci
  - file.infra.ci.pipeline
  - mod.tests.acceptance
  - mod.infra.observability
artifacts_to_create:
  - ".github/workflows/ci.yml"
  - "tests/acceptance/__init__ (as needed)"
  - "plans/rpg.json (committed, validated JSON)"
  - "STATUS.md (lightweight: progress/risks/next nodes)"
tasks:
  - Create CI workflow that runs on PR and main; steps: checkout, install deps, run lints, run tests; fail on nonzero exit.
  - Add a minimal test runner config (pytest, npm test, go test, etc.); include a passing smoke test to validate CI wiring.
  - Establish repository layout: src/api, src/core, src/storage, src/infra, tests/acceptance, plans/.
  - Commit current RPG file and ensure JSON schema/formatting checks (pre-commit or equivalent).
acceptance_criteria:
  - CI must execute automatically on PRs and main; visible green run with the smoke test.
  - Lint/test jobs are required for merge (branch protection documented in STATUS.md).
  - Repository layout exists and matches nodes in rpg.json.
  - rpg.json parses and contains nodes/edges/topo_layers defined above.
dependencies: []
risk_notes:
  - None material; infra-only change; no product logic.
