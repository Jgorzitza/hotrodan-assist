## 🎯 100% COMPLETION SUMMARY
**Status**: ✅ **approvals.final-integration COMPLETE - MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**

## Current Sprint Tasks (Production Readiness)
Status: TODO
- SSE provider stability; reconnect logic; backpressure handling.
- Audit logging for all actions; PII redaction checks.
- Error handling surfaces; actionable guidance for failures.
Acceptance:
- SSE remains stable for 10min soak; logs present; no PII leaks in logs.

## Focus
- Inbox page that displays draft replies; Approve → send via Zoho; Edit → store human+machine pair.
- Telemetry: approval rate, edit distance, average time-to-approve.
- Integration: reads drafts from `rag` and posts decisions back to storage.

## First Actions Now
- Set ASSISTANTS_BASE for local dev and run SSE smoke:
```bash
export ASSISTANTS_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8002
curl -N --max-time 3 "$ASSISTANTS_BASE/assistants/events" | head -n1 || true
```
- When the assistants service is reachable, smoke the Approve/Edit flow (expects 303 redirects):
```bash
# GET drafts -> render in UI (manual browser check), then POST approve/edit endpoints
```

## Continuous Work Protocol
- Every 5 minutes append proof-of-work (diff/tests/artifacts) to feedback/approvals.md.
- If blocked >1 minute, log blocker and start fallback; never idle.

## Next 5 Tasks (updated 2025-10-01 08:29 UTC)
1) SSE stability: reconnect/backpressure/error surfaces
2) Audit logging + PII redaction
3) Assistants smoke when base reachable; verify approve/edit 303 flow
4) Add /health and /ready endpoints to approval-app
5) Append soak results to feedback/approvals.md
- Stabilize SSE provider: reconnect, backpressure, error surfaces.
- Add audit logs; verify PII redaction.
- Append soak test outcomes to feedback/approvals.md.

## Production Today — Priority Override (2025-10-01)

Goals (EOD):
- SSE stable (10‑minute soak) OR UI gated gracefully; audit logging + PII redaction active; /health and /ready verified.

Tasks (EOD):
1) Verify ASSISTANTS_BASE and curl SSE; implement reconnect/backpressure/error surfaces; record 10‑minute soak result.
2) Add audit logs with PII redaction; attach masked sample logs to feedback/approvals.md.
3) Verify /health and /ready endpoints; add to runbook.

Acceptance:
- SSE soak passes without disconnects OR gating banner active with clear messaging.
- Audit log sample shows masked PII.
- /health and /ready return 200.

### CEO Dependencies — Today
- Provide ASSISTANTS_BASE only if service is hosted behind a CEO-controlled URL; otherwise proceed with local/compose defaults.
