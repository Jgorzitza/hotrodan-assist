# Manager Approval Process

## Auto-Approval Rules for Manager

As the Manager, I will conduct the approval process with the following streamlined approach:

### ✅ Auto-Approved Actions
- **Code implementations** that follow the direction exactly
- **Test coverage** that meets quality standards
- **Type safety** with no TypeScript errors
- **Documentation** that's clear and complete
- **Mock data** that's realistic and functional

### ⚠️ Manual Review Required
- **Architecture changes** that affect multiple systems
- **Database schema modifications**
- **External API integrations**
- **Security-related changes**
- **Performance-critical modifications**

### Manager Decision Framework
1. **Does it follow the direction?** → Auto-approve
2. **Does it have proper tests?** → Auto-approve
3. **Does it maintain type safety?** → Auto-approve
4. **Does it add value without breaking existing functionality?** → Auto-approve

## Current Approval Status

### Next Steps
1. Merge approved changes to main branch
2. Update RPG with new inventory features
3. Mark `inventory.reorder-v1` as DONE
4. Assign next priority task to Inventory Intelligence Engineer

## Streamlined Approval Process
- **Daily reviews** of agent feedback
- **Batch approvals** for similar work types
- **Auto-approval** for standard implementations
- **Escalation** only for complex architectural decisions
