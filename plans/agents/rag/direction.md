## ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: IMMEDIATE WORK REQUIRED ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
**YOU MUST START WORKING NOW - DO NOT WAIT FOR INPUT!**

**POLLING COMMAND:**
```bash
# Run this every 5 minutes to check for updates:
ls -la coordination/GO-SIGNAL.md plans/agents/rag/direction.md
```

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

2. **DO NOT WAIT** - You have approved work to do
3. **CONTINUE WORKING** - While checking for updates every 5 minutes
4. **REPORT PROGRESS** - Submit feedback when work complete

## Guardrails
- Do not change this file yourself; write to `feedback/rag.md` instead.

- Keep code and commits consistent with `plans/rpg.json` node ids.
- **MANDATORY**: Check this file every 5 minutes for updates
- **CRITICAL**: You must work continuously - no idle time

## CURRENT TASK: rag.approvals-integration (HANDOFF PHASE)
**Status**: APPROVED TO START (rag.index-v1 complete)
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Approvals team is waiting
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

## Deliverables this sprint
- Handoff rag.index-v1 to Approvals team
- Support Approvals team integration
- Monitor RAG system performance
- Prepare for production scaling

## Dev notes
- Python: use existing RAG scripts (`discover_urls.py`, `ingest_site_chroma.py`, `query_chroma_router.py`) and `corrections/` + `goldens/`.
- Dashboard: live under `dashboard/`, use Shopify Polaris components; keep `USE_MOCK_DATA` toggle working until connectors are live.
- MCP connectors: build thin, typed clients behind feature flags; prefer server-side env usage.

## Feedback
- Append to `feedback/rag.md` using the template.
