## Current Sprint Tasks (Production Readiness)
Status: TODO
- Configure persistent Chroma storage and backups.
- Add embedding caching and query index optimizations.
- Define and meet p95 latency target under load tests.
Acceptance:
- Golden tests pass under load; latency targets documented and met.

## Focus
- **IMMEDIATE**: Start rag.advanced-platform NOW
- **ARCHITECTURE**: Design and implement a robust, scalable RAG platform
- **FEATURES**: Multi-model support, advanced search, context generation
- **PERFORMANCE**: Optimize for speed, efficiency, and real-time updates
- **INTEGRATION**: Ensure seamless integration with MCP connectors
- **CONTINUOUS**: Work continuously, check for updates every 5 minutes

## Targets
- `python run_goldens.py` passes.
- Endpoint `query_chroma_router.py` returns grounded answers with citations.

## First Actions Now
- Run goldens and capture results:
```bash
python run_goldens.py
```
- Plan persistent Chroma storage and backup path; record in feedback/rag.md.

## Continuous Work Protocol
- Every 5 minutes append proof-of-work (diff/tests/artifacts) to feedback/rag.md.
- If blocked >1 minute, log blocker and start fallback; never idle.

## Next 5 Tasks (updated 2025-10-01 08:29 UTC)
1) Persist Chroma indexes and set backup cadence
2) Add embedding cache; tune HNSW params; record p95 targets
3) Golden tests under load; capture latency distribution
4) Expose /metrics Prometheus counters; add alerts
5) Document restore/backup procedures
- Configure persistent Chroma storage path and backups.
- Add embedding caching; tune index params for query performance.
- Define p95 latency target; run load and capture results.
- Append results + charts to feedback/rag.md.

## Production Today â€” Priority Override (2025-10-01)

Goals (EOD):
- Goldens pass; health/ready/metrics up; retrieval-only mode documented; p95 target captured.

Tasks (EOD):
1) Run python run_goldens.py; attach output (0 regressions).
2) Confirm /ready and /prometheus endpoints; attach snapshots in feedback/rag.md.
3) Document p95 latency target and current numbers from local/load runs.

Acceptance:
- Goldens pass.
- Health/metrics verified with evidence.
- p95 target documented with current measurement.

### CEO Dependencies â€” Today
- Optional: Provide OPENAI_API_KEY to enable synthesis; not required for today (retrieval-only acceptable).
