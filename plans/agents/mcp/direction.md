## Current Sprint Tasks (Production Readiness)
Status: DOING
- Add rate limiting and retry policies for all connectors.
- Implement connection pooling, timeouts; circuit breaker where appropriate.
- Wire error tracking and metrics dashboards per connector.
Acceptance:
- Synthetic calls demonstrate retry/backoff; dashboards show error rates, p95 latency; SLOs defined.

## Focus
- Build connectors (Shopify Admin, Zoho Mail, GSC, Bing WMT, GA4) as separate modules with consistent error envelopes.
- Add health checks and feature flags; never crash the dashboard on 401/403/timeouts.
- Provide typed DTOs and minimal caching (ETag/If-Modified-Since where applicable).

## First Actions Now
- Run MCP mocks and reliability suites:
```bash
npx vitest run --root dashboard --config dashboard/vitest.config.ts \
  dashboard/app/lib/mcp/__tests__/*.test.ts \
  dashboard/app/lib/connectors/__tests__/registry.server.test.ts \
  dashboard/app/lib/streaming/__tests__/*.test.ts
```
- Live validation (requires secrets provided):
```bash
npx prisma generate --schema dashboard/prisma/schema.prisma
ENABLE_MCP=true USE_MOCK_DATA=false \
MCP_API_URL={{MCP_API_URL}} MCP_API_KEY={{MCP_API_KEY}} \
  npx vitest run --root dashboard --config dashboard/vitest.config.ts \
  dashboard/app/lib/mcp/__tests__/live-connection.test.ts
```

## Continuous Work Protocol
- Every 5 minutes append proof-of-work (diff/tests/artifacts) to feedback/mcp.md.
- If blocked >1 minute, log blocker and start fallback; never idle.

## Next 5 Tasks (updated 2025-10-01 08:29 UTC)
1) Finalize rate limit/retry/pooling defaults; config via env
2) Expose connector health and metrics to dashboard routes
3) Add circuit breaker dashboards + alerts
4) Write integration tests over registry + protocol contracts
5) Prepare live-connect playbook gated by creds
- Add rate limiting and retries to all connectors; set sane timeouts.
- Implement connection pooling and circuit breaker where applicable.
- Emit metrics (error rate, p95 latency) per connector; dashboard visibility.
- Append test runs + metrics screenshots to feedback/mcp.md.

## Production Today â€” Priority Override (2025-10-01)

First Directive â€” MCP Live Validation + Tunnel (with CEO)
- Work directly with the CEO to obtain MCP_API_URL and MCP_API_KEY for live validation.
- Coordinate with Dashboard to capture the Cloudflare tunnel URL and confirm application_url/redirects are correct for embedded Admin.
- Execute the live validation suite immediately after envs are set; attach outputs and next steps to feedback/mcp.md and coordination/inbox/mcp/DATE-notes.md.

Goals (EOD):
- Lock rate limit/retry/timeouts/pooling defaults; surface connector health/metrics to Dashboard; run live validation when env present; fallback to mock otherwise.

Tasks (EOD):
1) Finalize defaults; expose env knobs; attach config snippet to feedback/mcp.md.
2) Surface connector health + metrics in settings route; attach example JSON snapshot to feedback.
3) Execute live validation with MCP_API_URL/MCP_API_KEY when provided; else record blocked status and keep mocks.

Acceptance:
- vitest live-connection test passes when env provided.
- /app/metrics shows connector metrics; settings UI lists connector statuses.
- Clear fallback behaviour (no crashes) when live env missing.

### CEO Dependencies â€” Today
- Provide MCP_API_URL and MCP_API_KEY for live validation.
