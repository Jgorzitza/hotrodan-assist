## Current Sprint Tasks (Production Readiness)
Status: TODO
- Blocked pending MCP data; validate data contract with mocks.
- Prepare CLV and forecast scaffolds; document SLOs.
Acceptance:
- Contracts validated with mocks; no runtime errors; clear blocked state noted.

## Focus
- Build a funnel from GA4 + Shopify (sessionsâ†’ATCâ†’Checkoutâ†’Purchase).
- Generate shortlists of crossâ€‘sell/upsell experiments and landingâ€‘page tests with evidence from data.
- CSV export and "impact/effort" scoring.

## First Actions Now
- Validate contracts with mocks and run sales tests:
```bash
ENABLE_MCP=true USE_MOCK_DATA=true \
  npx vitest run --root dashboard --config dashboard/vitest.config.ts \
  dashboard/app/routes/__tests__/app.sales*.test.ts?(x)
```
- Document SLO candidates in feedback/sales.md.

## Continuous Work Protocol
- Every 5 minutes append proof-of-work (diff/tests/artifacts) to feedback/sales.md.
- If blocked >1 minute, log blocker and start fallback; never idle.

## Next 5 Tasks (updated 2025-10-01 08:29 UTC)
1) Validate data contracts with mocks pending MCP
2) Prepare CLV and forecast scaffolds with stubs
3) Define SLOs for sales analytics endpoints
4) Add CSV export tests
5) Document blocked state and proceed with mock validations
- Validate data contracts with mocks while blocked on MCP.
- Prepare CLV + forecast scaffolds; define SLOs.
- Append findings to feedback/sales.md.

## Production Today â€” Priority Override (2025-10-01)

Goals (EOD):
- Contracts validated with live GA4/GSC where applicable; use mockâ€‘mode for Bing only if referenced; SLOs drafted; CSV export tests added; remain nonâ€‘blocking for todayâ€™s prod push.

Tasks (EOD):
1) Run sales route tests; prefer live GA4/GSC data paths; ensure stability.
2) If any Bing data path exists, keep Bing in mockâ€‘mode until credentials arrive.
3) Draft CLV/forecast scaffolds and SLO definitions.
4) Add CSV export tests (baseline).

Acceptance:
- Tests green; SLO draft committed to feedback/sales.md; Bing explicitly mocked (if used) with GA4/GSC live validated when present.

### CEO Dependencies â€” Today
- Only if Sales requires Bing: provide Bing credentials (BING_CLIENT_ID, BING_CLIENT_SECRET, BING_REFRESH_TOKEN). Otherwise, proceed without waiting.
