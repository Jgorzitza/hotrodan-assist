Use this note to suggest updates to `prompts/dashboard/database.md` or related scope. Do **not** edit the master prompt without Program Manager sign-off.

- Immediate focus: await infrastructure decision (Fly vs Render) so ops can schedule `/cron/retention` via the documented checklist, keep UI/service owners aligned on the Prisma repository rollout, and capture Postgres pooling/backup decisions in the coordination memo once the provider is selected.
- Log future proposals here with rationale, dependencies, and test impact for review.
