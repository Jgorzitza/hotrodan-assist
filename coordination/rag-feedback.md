# RAG Agent Feedback Log

Use this note to propose updates to `agents.md` (RAG section) or ingest/corrections scope. Do **not** edit the shared playbook or prompts directly without Program Manager approval.

## 2025-09-27 Program Manager Directive
- Immediate focus: rerun ingest + goldens only when sitemap timestamps change, expand corrections alongside matching golden coverage, and log each loop in `SESSION_SUMMARY_*`.
- Record future suggestions here with rationale, dependencies, and validation steps; the Program Manager will review before updating shared docs.
