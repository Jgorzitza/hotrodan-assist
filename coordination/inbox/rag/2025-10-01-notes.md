## RAG Production Rollout - 2025-10-01T02:05:38-06:00
- Poller: active (nohup)
- Ingest: incremental refresh completed; goldens passed
- Compose: rag-api/db/redis up
- Health: {"status":"healthy","mode":"retrieval-only","openai_available":true}
- Smoke: retrieval-only query succeeded with sources
## EOD Update - RAG Data Engineer - 2025-10-01T02:59:18-06:00
- Status: rag-api running in production (docker compose), retrieval-only mode; health OK.
- Poller: 5-minute GO-SIGNAL/direction poller active (nohup).
- Ingestion: incremental refresh run; goldens passing.
- Observability: /metrics (JSON) and /prometheus (Prometheus) live; OTEL hooks configured.
- Reliability: restart policy + healthcheck; readiness endpoint /ready live.
- Features shipped today: Redis caching, per-IP rate limiting, optional bearer auth, CORS, corrections-first, SSE streaming (/query/stream), analytics (/analytics/queries), A/B assignment (/ab/assign), admin cache clear, Prometheus metrics, readiness.
- Background: 15-min discover → ingest_incremental_chroma → run_goldens loop running (nohup).
- Health snapshot: {"status":"healthy","mode":"retrieval-only","openai_available":true}
- Risks/Notes: OPENAI key is invalid; service pinned to retrieval-only for stability. Hybrid rerank endpoint added; will continue stabilization next session.
- Next: MCP CLI checks + logs, expand tests (query smoke/cache/rate-limit), stabilize /query/hybrid under curl, add worker and timeout tunables, finalize dashboards.
2025-10-01T09:10:07-06:00 — RAG relaunch: goldens executed; system healthy.
