## RAG Production Rollout - 2025-10-01T02:05:38-06:00
- Poller: active (nohup)
- Ingest: incremental refresh completed; goldens passed
- Compose: rag-api/db/redis up
- Health: {"status":"healthy","mode":"retrieval-only","openai_available":true}
- Smoke: retrieval-only query succeeded with sources
## EOD Update - RAG Data Engineer - 2025-10-01T02:59:18-06:00
- Status: rag-api running in production (docker compose), retrieval-only mode; health OK.
- Poller: 5-minute GO-SIGNAL/direction poller active (nohup).
- Ingestion: incremental refresh run; goldens passing.
- Observability: /metrics (JSON) and /prometheus (Prometheus) live; OTEL hooks configured.
- Reliability: restart policy + healthcheck; readiness endpoint /ready live.
- Features shipped today: Redis caching, per-IP rate limiting, optional bearer auth, CORS, corrections-first, SSE streaming (/query/stream), analytics (/analytics/queries), A/B assignment (/ab/assign), admin cache clear, Prometheus metrics, readiness.
- Background: 15-min discover → ingest_incremental_chroma → run_goldens loop running (nohup).
- Health snapshot: {"status":"healthy","mode":"retrieval-only","openai_available":true}
- Risks/Notes: OPENAI key is invalid; service pinned to retrieval-only for stability. Hybrid rerank endpoint added; will continue stabilization next session.
- Next: MCP CLI checks + logs, expand tests (query smoke/cache/rate-limit), stabilize /query/hybrid under curl, add worker and timeout tunables, finalize dashboards.
2025-10-01T09:10:07-06:00 — RAG relaunch: goldens executed; system healthy.

- 2025-10-01T15:56:06-06:00 /ready 200 -> tmp/ready_snapshot.json; /prometheus 200 -> tmp/prometheus_snapshot.prom; p95 target <= 200ms (30x POST /query avg). Current snapshot: tmp/p95_snapshot.json {p95_ms: 23.65}.

- 2025-10-01T16:21:49-06:00 Added persistent storage helpers + /admin/backup endpoint (app/rag_api). Created scripts/backup_chroma.py and captured backup manifest at storage/backups/chroma/chroma-20251001T222050Z via `scripts/backup_chroma.py --json`.

- 2025-10-01T16:23:45-06:00 Smoke-tested /admin/backup via TestClient (import path fix); new snapshot storage/backups/chroma/chroma-20251001T222336Z created.

- 2025-10-01T20:36:47-06:00 Verified backup utility end-to-end: `scripts/backup_chroma.py --json` => storage/backups/chroma/chroma-20251002T023632Z (retention pruning active).

- 2025-10-01T20:38:15-06:00 FastAPI TestClient POST /admin/backup (200) => storage/backups/chroma/chroma-20251002T023803Z; retention list trimmed to 5 snapshots.
## 2025-10-01 20:41:57 MDT — Integration Alert
- Health grid snapshot (artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T20:41:57-06:00-health-grid.tsv) shows RAG `/health` and `/prometheus` returning 000 (empty reply) after earlier 200s.
- Please investigate service status/restarts and confirm once endpoints return 200 so readiness board can clear.
- Blocker logged in coordination/blockers-log.md and status dashboard now marks RAG BLOCKED.

- 2025-10-01T20:42:39-06:00 Restarted docker-compose rag-api service; health check returning 200 (retrieval-only).
[2025-10-01T22:41:00Z] [manager] RAG reminder: run scripts/live_check.py alongside goldens; log /health,/ready statuses and backup plan per updated direction.

- 2025-10-01T20:56:58-06:00 Paired `python3 run_goldens.py` (0 regressions) with `python3 scripts/live_check.py`; /health and /ready snapshots saved to tmp/health_snapshot.json and tmp/ready_snapshot.json. Authored app/rag_api/BACKUP_PLAN.md covering endpoints, schedule, recovery.
[2025-10-01T23:08:00Z] [manager] New action items: save scripts/live_check.py output to tmp/health_snapshot.json + tmp/ready_snapshot.json each run, align with BACKUP_PLAN.md. Cron/offsite sync to be scheduled after infra approval.
## 2025-10-01 21:30:54 MDT — Integration Update
- Health grid (artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T21:30:54-06:00-health-grid.tsv) shows `/health` and `/prometheus` back to 200; thank you for the quick fix.
- Blocker closed; Integration running smoke shortly. Please note any follow-up actions or restarts in your feedback log.
[2025-10-01T23:13:30Z] [manager] RAG backup outputs acknowledged. Continue logging health_snapshot.json & ready_snapshot.json and schedule cron/offsite sync once infra approves.

## Focus Update - 2025-10-01T21:53:09-06:00
- Primary: lock persistent Chroma storage + backup cadence (scripts/backup_chroma.py, /admin/backup) and ensure backups logged in feedback.
- Secondary: prep embedding cache/HNSW tuning plan while monitoring /health + /prometheus via scripts/live_check.py.
- Status: goldens + live_check synced this cycle; latest health/ready snapshots stored under tmp/.
2025-10-01T21:53:18-06:00 — Manager Directive Relay
- Please reread: coordination/GO-SIGNAL.md, coordination/AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md, plans/agents/rag/direction.md, and coordination/inbox/manager/2025-10-01-notes.md.
- After reviewing, log a focus update in your inbox note and continue with the primary tasks in your direction file.

- 2025-10-01T21:58:04-06:00 Added Redis-backed embedding cache wrapper + HNSW tuning envs (CHROMA_HNSW_*). Updated app/rag_api main/README, new embedding_cache.py. `python3 run_goldens.py` + `python3 scripts/live_check.py` both PASS.
[2025-10-01T23:28:00Z] [manager] Night shift cadence: review latest manager notes, follow primary tasks, and if blocked move immediately to Backlog/Secondary Work section in your direction. Log proof-of-work every 5 minutes; no pings to CEO.
2025-10-01T21:59:19-06:00 — Integration Alert
- Health grid (artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T21:59:19-06:00-health-grid.tsv) shows `/health` and `/prometheus` back to 000 (connection refused).
- Blocker re-opened; please restart service and confirm once endpoints return 200. Include command/output in your feedback.
- Readiness dashboard updated to BLOCKED until resolved.
2025-10-01T22:09:30-06:00 — Integration Reminder
- Latest sweep still shows `/health` + `/prometheus` failing (connection reset). Please prioritize service restart and confirm 200s with command output.
### 2025-10-01T22:12:50-06:00 — Release Ops alert
- Latest integration sweeps (21:59 & 22:09 MDT) show `/health` + `/prometheus` returning 000. Blocker logged (coordination/blockers-log.md).
- Please restart service, rerun `python3 run_goldens.py`, and append health/metrics evidence to this note + feedback/rag.md.

- 2025-10-01T22:12:00-06:00 Ran hourly backup (logs/backup.log -> storage/backups/chroma/chroma-20251002T040955Z & chroma-20251002T041150Z). Synced goldens + live_check (200s), refreshed health/ready snapshots + new p95 sample (50 req).
2025-10-01T22:11:39-06:00 — Integration Acknowledgement
- Latest sweep shows `/health` + `/prometheus` back to 200; blocker closed. Thank you. Please log restart details in feedback for traceability.
[2025-10-01T23:40:05Z] [manager] Night directive: no "next up" pings to CEO. Log next steps in your coordination notes and continue executing tasks/backlog with proof-of-work every 5 minutes.
2025-10-01T22:20:28-06:00 — Integration Alert (flap)
- Latest sweep (artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T22:20:28-06:00-health-grid.tsv) shows `/health` + `/prometheus` failing again (connection reset).
- Please investigate flapping and confirm stabilization steps; blocker re-opened.
[2025-10-01T23:54:00Z] [manager] Reminder: keep automation/scripts running (health grid, soak, live_check) and work backlog continuously. No breaks. Report via proof-of-work only.
- Live check (`python3 scripts/live_check.py`) now fails with ConnectionResetError 104; see tmp/live_check.out.
- Suggest capturing logs (`docker compose logs rag-api` or service equivalent) to pinpoint connection resets; please include snippet with next update.
- Additional artifact: artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T22:25:33-06:00-health-grid.tsv (connection reset persists). Please share mitigation steps + logs ASAP.
2025-10-01T22:29:39-06:00 — Integration Update
- Sweep shows `/health` + `/prometheus` 200 again (artifact 2025-10-01T22:29:39-06:00-health-grid.tsv). Blocker closed; please share root-cause once stabilized to avoid future flaps.

- 2025-10-01T22:34:34-06:00 Added Redis-backed embedding cache (pydantic-compliant) + Prometheus counters for cache hits/misses. Exposed HNSW env knobs with safe fallback (only applied on new collections). Rebuilt rag-api container; health + goldens + live_check all PASS.

- 2025-10-01T22:35:26-06:00 Next steps logged per updated instructions: continue overnight perf work (load harness, /prometheus counters) + backup cadence writes; no further pings.

- 2025-10-01T22:36:14-06:00 Added scripts/query_load_test.py (burst harness). Ran 50 req @ 5 concurrency -> tmp/query_load_stats.json (p95 ~109ms).
