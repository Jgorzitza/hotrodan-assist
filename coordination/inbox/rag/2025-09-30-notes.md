**Session Start**: $(date -Iseconds)
**Mode**: AUTONOMOUS OVERNIGHT DEVELOPMENT
**Duration**: 6-8 hours continuous work
**Task Set**: 35 tasks from OVERNIGHT_TASKS.md

## Session Goals
1. Fix TestClient import wiring (Task #1 - CRITICAL)
2. Complete comprehensive testing framework (Tasks 2-6)
3. Implement query analytics and insights (Tasks 7-12)
4. Add API rate limiting and throttling (Tasks 13-18)
5. Advanced RAG optimizations (Tasks 19-30)

## Progress Log

[2025-09-29T22:04:08-06:00] Task #1 COMPLETE - TestClient Import Wiring Fixed
- Created app/rag_api/__init__.py to make it a proper Python package
- Fixed sys.path setup in scripts/test_rag_api.py
- Upgraded fastapi (0.104.1 â†’ 0.118.0) and starlette (0.27.0 â†’ 0.48.0) to fix TestClient compatibility
- Fixed imports in app/rag_api/main.py to use proper package paths (app.rag_api.*)
- Comprehensive test suite now running successfully
- Status: âœ… COMPLETE

[2025-09-29T22:04:08-06:00] Task #1b IN PROGRESS - MODEL_SELECTOR Integration
- Current issue: /query endpoint not using MODEL_SELECTOR, still using old GENERATION_MODE logic
- Need to: 
  1. Add 'provider' parameter to QueryIn model
  2. Use MODEL_SELECTOR.choose() in query endpoint
  3. Return provider_info in response
  4. Update /config endpoint with available_providers
- Status: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

[$(date -Iseconds)] Tasks #1, #1b, #1c COMPLETE - MODEL_SELECTOR Integration Success âœ…
- âœ… Fixed TestClient import wiring (app/__init__.py created, sys.path handling)
- âœ… Upgraded fastapi (0.104.1 â†’ 0.118.0) and starlette (0.27.0 â†’ 0.48.0)
- âœ… Fixed all imports in main.py to use app.rag_api.* package paths
- âœ… Added Optional, Dict, Any to typing imports
- âœ… Added 'provider' parameter to QueryIn model
- âœ… Added 'available_providers' field to ConfigResponse model
- âœ… Integrated MODEL_SELECTOR.choose() into /query endpoint
- âœ… Added provider_info to query responses
- âœ… Updated /config endpoint with MODEL_SELECTOR.provider_summary()
- âœ… All tests passing with correct provider routing

Test Results:
- Test 1: retrieval-only mode works with provider override
- Test 2: Default mode correctly selects OpenAI (highest priority)
- Test 3: Config endpoint lists all 4 available providers

Next: Tasks 2-6 (Comprehensive testing framework)

[$(date -Iseconds)] Tasks #2-6 COMPLETE - Comprehensive Testing Framework âœ…
- âœ… Created app/rag_api/tests/ directory structure
- âœ… Created unit tests for MODEL_SELECTOR (6 tests)
  - Initialization, provider availability, selection logic, fallback behavior
- âœ… Created API integration tests (8 tests)
  - Health endpoint validation
  - Config endpoint with provider listing
  - Query endpoint with various scenarios (valid, retrieval-only, invalid inputs)
  - Metrics endpoint verification
- âœ… All 14 tests passing successfully
- âœ… Test coverage includes: MODEL_SELECTOR, provider routing, all major endpoints

Test Results Summary:
- 6/6 MODEL_SELECTOR unit tests passed
- 8/8 API integration tests passed
- Total: 14/14 tests passed âœ…

Next: Tasks 7-12 (Query analytics implementation)

[$(date -Iseconds)] Tasks #7-12 COMPLETE - Query Analytics Implementation âœ…
- âœ… Created comprehensive analytics module (analytics.py)
  - QueryAnalytics class with advanced tracking
  - Provider-specific metrics (count, avg_time, error_rate, avg_sources)
  - Quality score calculation (speed + sources)
  - Performance metrics (avg, median, p95 response times)
  - Usage pattern analytics (hourly distribution, peak hours)
  - Dashboard data aggregation
- âœ… Integrated analytics into main API
  - Added ANALYTICS tracking to query endpoint
  - Track successful queries with full metrics
  - Track failed queries with error details
  - Automatic persistence every 10 queries
- âœ… Added 4 new analytics endpoints:
  - /analytics/dashboard - Comprehensive dashboard data
  - /analytics/providers - Provider-specific metrics
  - /analytics/performance - Performance metrics
  - /analytics/usage - Usage pattern analytics
- âœ… All analytics endpoints tested and working

Analytics Features:
- Quality scoring (0-1 based on speed and source count)
- Per-provider tracking (openai, anthropic, local, retrieval-only)
- Performance percentiles (avg, median, p95)
- Hourly query distribution and peak hour detection
- Success/error rate tracking
- Last 1000 queries stored with auto-persistence

Next: Tasks 13-18 (API rate limiting)
