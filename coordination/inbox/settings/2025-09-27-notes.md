# 2025-09-27 Settings Agent Notes

## Next
- [Data-layer] Provide the live credential handoff bundle (GA4 service account JSON stub, GSC site token, Bing API key, MCP API endpoint/key expectations) plus env var mapping so Settings can flip `USE_MOCK_DATA=false` in staging.
- [Shared] Coordinate Prisma fixture refresh (StoreSettings, StoreSecret, ConnectionEvent) once Data-layer finalises IDs so Vitest + Playwright can run against the same seed data.
- [Settings] After the credential bundle lands, rerun `npm exec vitest run app/routes/__tests__/app.settings.test.ts app/routes/__tests__/app.settings.prisma.test.ts` and capture the staging verification checklist.
- Document any KMS/retention observations in this note—implementation waits for hosting choice.

## Updates
- 2025-09-27 18:04 MDT — `npm exec vitest run app/routes/__tests__/app.settings.test.ts app/routes/__tests__/app.settings.prisma.test.ts` green on `feature/approval-app`; repository + loader/action coverage confirmed with Prisma stub.
- Removed unused `ThresholdSettings` import; lint now clean.
- 2025-09-27 18:31 MDT — Re-ran `npm exec vitest run app/routes/__tests__/app.settings.test.ts app/routes/__tests__/app.settings.prisma.test.ts`; suites remain green while waiting on live credential bundle.
- 2025-09-27 18:36 MDT — Logged credential bundle + Prisma seed request with Data (see coordination/inbox/data/2025-09-27-notes.md) so we can validate settings flows once live fixtures land.
