# 2025-09-27 Dashboard Agent Notes

## Next
- When the dev tunnel returns, smoke `/app` range toggles in the embedded shell to confirm `range`/`mockState` persistence.
- Coordinate with Data-layer on the incoming analytics contract so real trend payloads can flow straight through `calculateTrendStats`.

## Updates
- Validated home overview widgets render with Polaris Viz sparkline and shared range filters; lint still blocked on sync/inbox debt, vitest app._index suite passes.
- Re-ran `npm run lint` (warnings only) and `npm exec vitest run app/routes/__tests__/app._index.test.ts --config vitest.config.ts` to confirm dashboard home coverage stays green after the latest sparkline work.
- Dev tunnel not accessible from CLI, unable to run `/app` smoke today; pending next tunnel window.
- Added `app/lib/__tests__/date-range.test.ts` coverage and re-ran the suite alongside the dashboard loader tests; both pass locally with the updated shared filter helpers.
- Quick status double-check today: no new UI deltas on `/app`, `npm run lint` still surfaces only the existing `consistent-type-imports` warnings, and the dashboard home vitest target continues to pass.
