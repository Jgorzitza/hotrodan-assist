# Manager Status Update — Dashboard/Polaris v12 + TS Hardening
Time: 2025-10-01T21:00:53Z
Owner: Agent Mode (Warp)
Scope: Dashboard (Remix + Polaris v12), Webhooks/Prisma typing, Shopify server config, SEO adapters, TypeScript error reduction

Summary
- Polaris v12 migration (targeted routes) is on track:
  - app.sales.tsx migrated and clean (TitleBar removal, Card API, ButtonGroup segmented removal, Text.as, etc.).
  - app._index.tsx and app.settings.tsx scanned target ranges; already compliant in those ranges; minor App Bridge toast fix applied.
  - app.seo.tsx required no v12 changes in scanned blocks; adapters updated to match call signatures.
- TypeScript error count reduced in dashboard from 123 → 113 → 80 → 75 with focused fixes.
- Webhooks + Prisma JSON typing hardened to eliminate JSON-shape errors and unsafe spreads.
- Shopify server typing friction reduced to unblock compilation (temporary casts added; follow-up cleanup listed below).

Verification (proof-of-work)
- Root typecheck: clean (npm run typecheck)
- Dashboard typecheck (npx tsc --noEmit -p dashboard/tsconfig.json)
  - Error reduction snapshots:
    - Pre-fixes: 123 errors in 38 files
    - After adapters/date-range/shopify+webhooks part 1: 113 errors in 35 files
    - After seed/mocks + webhooks part 2 + login route fixes: 80 errors in 34 files
    - After final Prisma JSON casts + route cleanup: 75 errors in 31 files

Current TypeScript error inventory (top categories)
1) Inbox/inventory small type gaps
   - assistants.server.ts: returning ‘escalated’ in metrics but type lacks it
   - assistants.stream.server.ts: message possibly undefined → requires fallback
   - inventory/live.server.ts: implicit any on resp/json/pageInfo
2) MCP typing/connectors
   - client.server.ts generic returns unknown → tighten generics
   - connectors.server.ts comparison type mismatch on ConnectorId
3) Shopify Admin + webhooks typing
   - lib/shopify/admin.ts: AdminClient type w/ removeRest: true (rest missing); update types or adapt union
   - routes/webhooks.* expect AdminApiContextWithRest — reconcile with removeRest or provide shim
   - webhooks queue job type (BullWebhookJobData) missing shop → use shopDomain exclusively
4) SEO persistence (Prisma enums/types used as types instead of typeof)
   - SeoInsightSeverity/Status used as types; should use typeof or enum mapping
5) Settings fixtures/repository (Prisma enums)
   - SettingsSecretProvider, IntegrationProvider, ConnectionEventStatus used as value types in type positions; use typeof
   - repository.server.ts references ConnectionHealth name not found; ensure proper type import/alias
6) Test suite/config friction (quick wins)
   - routes/__tests__/app.metrics.test.ts duplicate import of resetAll
   - inbox telemetry test missing afterAll import
   - msw/seo-handlers generic needs JsonBodyType constraint
   - tests using possibly undefined fields (payload.csv, availableScenarios) — add guards
   - vitest.config.ts plugin typing: use proper apply: "serve" | "build" or predicate; do not mutate env; remove hmr config in wrong place
7) Prisma JSON in seed: two lines still assign metadata as Record<string, unknown> where Prisma expects InputJsonValue (seed.ts:447, 455) — needs casting (low risk)

Risks / blockers
- Casting to any/Prisma.InputJsonValue was used to unblock compilation in webhooks/shopify areas; we should follow up to replace temporary casts with typed transformations to prevent regressions.
- Shopify Admin typing mismatch arises from removeRest: true future flag; downstream handlers expect rest. We need a consistent strategy (either add rest in types or alter consumer expectations).
- Test lane still blocked by config typing and mocks friction; quick wins listed below will reduce noise but might not fully green UI tests without prior A/B/C decision.

Recommendations (prioritized next steps)
P0 (unblock compilation hot spots)
1) Inbox/Inventory small fixes
   - assistants.server.ts: remove ‘escalated’ from returned metrics or extend type
   - assistants.stream.server.ts: fallback message to "" when undefined
   - inventory/live.server.ts: add explicit types to resp/json/pageInfo
2) Shopify Admin/webhooks typing consolidation
   - Update Shopify webhook handler context types to accept AdminApiContextWithoutRest (or union) when removeRest=true
   - Provide a typed adapter for SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_REGISTRATION → WebhookConfig with callbacks, eliminating as any on shopifyApp config
   - webhooks/queue.server.ts: rely solely on job.data.shopDomain
3) SEO persistence enum/value types
   - Replace SeoInsightSeverity/Status as types with typeof; ensure mapping objects use $Enums where needed

P1 (reduce test friction + Prisma JSON tidy-up)
4) Vitest config typing
   - Replace plugin with a minimal typed plugin (apply: "serve"); avoid mutating env.listen; remove hmr from wrong scope
5) Test/mocks quick wins
   - Fix duplicate resetAll imports
   - Add afterAll import where used
   - Add guards in tests for possibly undefined fields
   - Constrain msw handler generic with JsonBodyType
6) Seed
   - Cast event.metadata to Prisma.InputJsonValue in remaining lines (seed.ts:447, 455)

P2 (cleanup temporary casts and hardening)
7) Replace any/unknown casts in webhooks persistence with typed codecs
8) Replace shopify.server.ts any casts with structured adapters and types
9) Add unit tests around webhook persistence JSON shapes to lock behavior

Decision requests
- UI test lane: path A (install devDeps) vs B (alias/shims + jsdom) vs C (skip UI suites). Current typing fixes improve stability but not a full green without a chosen path.
- Shopify Admin rest vs no-rest: confirm whether we maintain removeRest=true; if so, we’ll adapt all handlers to AdminApiContextWithoutRest and adjust types accordingly.

Planned immediate actions (next cycle)
- Apply P0 small fixes (Inbox/Inventory), Shopify Admin/webhooks types, SEO persistence types.
- Then address P1 Vitest config + test quick wins.
- Re-run dashboard typecheck to confirm delta and report updated counts.

Proof-of-work commands
- npm run typecheck (root) → OK
- npx -y tsc --noEmit -p dashboard/tsconfig.json → errors reduced stepwise as reported above (latest: 75 in 31 files)

Next check-in
- 2025-10-01T21:05Z (+5m cadence)
- Will post a delta with updated TypeScript error count and list any new blockers immediately.
