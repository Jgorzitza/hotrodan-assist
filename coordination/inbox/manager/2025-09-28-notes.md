# 2025-09-28 Program Manager Notes

## Summary
- Corrected path confusion (prior session touched `hotrodan-assist`; actual workspace `llama_rag`).
- Audited existing coordination artifacts; confirmed feedback workflow and dependency matrix remain current.
- Added coordination ops files (`README.md`, `note-template.md`, `status-dashboard.md`, `blockers-log.md`, `reporting-playbook.md`) and ensured manager inbox exists.

## Metrics & Checks
- Tests: not run (documentation/coordination updates only).
- Branch: chore/coordination (virtual).
- Commits pushed? no.

## Status Updates
- RAG & Corrections – Fresh ingest/goldens sweep from 2025-09-27 confirmed; dashboard row seeded.
- Sync & Webhooks – Write API contract memo still open; blockers log captures outstanding payload docs.
- Orders – Vitest coverage green; pending live wiring note in status dashboard for next sweep.
- Sales – Deferred Polaris Viz upgrade recorded as blocker + status dashboard entry.

## Blockers / Risks
- Credentials for Settings/SEO remain outstanding (logged in blockers log).
- Analytics contract publication gating Sales/Data progress.

## Next Actions
1. Review latest agent notes post-next sweep and update dashboard rows accordingly.
2. Ping Sync agent once write API docs land to close blocker.
3. Capture next goldens/ingest run in session summary if sitemap changes.

## Notes
- Added manager inbox directory to align with registry expectations.
- Need to regen managed instructions after next full sweep to pull in new coordination docs.
