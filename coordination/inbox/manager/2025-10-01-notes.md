# Manager Notes — 2025-10-01

Decision: Enter Production Readiness sequence. Approvals Policy in effect (manager edits pre-approved). Critical path assigned and marked DOING in backlog and dashboard.

Immediate priorities:
1) Tooling — prod pipeline: Docker + CI/CD + health + alerts
2) Dashboard — live data: remove USE_MOCK_DATA; wire MCP; error boundaries; CSP
3) MCP — production monitoring: rate limiting/retry; error tracking; SLO dashboards

Cadence:
- Sweep every 5 minutes and update GO-SIGNAL, dashboard, directions as needed
- Validate CI green and health endpoints once Tooling pushes

Blockers to watch:

08:33 UTC — Policy reinforcement: Added Continuous Work Protocol. Agents must append proof-of-work every 5 minutes or log blocker + start fallback. GO-SIGNAL updated with compliance enforcement.
- Credentials (GA4/GSC/Bing) — keep features gated and degrade to mocks
- Shopify tunnel config stability for dashboard dev

08:06 UTC — Sweep executed. GO-SIGNAL timestamp updated. Quality suite run triggered. No new blockers recorded.
08:09 UTC — Sweep executed. GO-SIGNAL timestamp updated. Quality suite run triggered. No new blockers recorded.
08:11 UTC — Sweep executed. GO-SIGNAL timestamp updated. Quality suite run triggered. No new blockers recorded.
08:23 UTC — Sweep executed. GO-SIGNAL timestamp updated. Quality suite run triggered. No new blockers recorded.
08:10 UTC — Note: Dashboard test env missing dev deps (@shopify/polaris, @shopify/app-bridge-react, @faker-js/faker, bullmq, jsdom) and @prisma/client load under vitest fixtures; proceeding without installs per guardrails. Guidance requested on allowing a devDependencies install or adjusting test config to skip UI libs in server-only tests.
08:30 UTC — Decision request: Approve one of the following for test lane:
- A) Install required devDependencies (Polaris, App Bridge, jsdom, faker, bullmq) for CI test env
- B) Add Vite/vitest aliases to mock @shopify/polaris and @shopify/app-bridge-react to minimal shims; add jsdom as test environment
- C) Mark UI-heavy suites as skipped in CI and run server-only subsets green
Rationale: Server-side subsets are green; UI deps block full-run. Proceeding with server-side subsets until guidance.
