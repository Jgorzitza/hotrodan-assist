# Manager Notes — 2025-10-01

Decision: Enter Production Readiness sequence. Approvals Policy in effect (manager edits pre-approved). Critical path assigned and marked DOING in backlog and dashboard.

Immediate priorities:
1) Tooling — prod pipeline: Docker + CI/CD + health + alerts
2) Dashboard — live data: remove USE_MOCK_DATA; wire MCP; error boundaries; CSP
3) MCP — production monitoring: rate limiting/retry; error tracking; SLO dashboards

Cadence:
- Sweep every 5 minutes and update GO-SIGNAL, dashboard, directions as needed
- Validate CI green and health endpoints once Tooling pushes

Blockers to watch:
- Credentials (GA4/GSC/Bing) — keep features gated and degrade to mocks
- Shopify tunnel config stability for dashboard dev

08:06 UTC — Sweep executed. GO-SIGNAL timestamp updated. Quality suite run triggered. No new blockers recorded.
