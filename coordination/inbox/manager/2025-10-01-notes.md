# Manager Notes — 2025-10-01

Decision: Enter Production Readiness sequence. Approvals Policy in effect (manager edits pre-approved). Critical path assigned and marked DOING in backlog and dashboard.

Immediate priorities:
1) Tooling — prod pipeline: Docker + CI/CD + health + alerts
2) Dashboard — live data: remove USE_MOCK_DATA; wire MCP; error boundaries; CSP
3) MCP — production monitoring: rate limiting/retry; error tracking; SLO dashboards

Cadence:
- Sweep every 5 minutes and update GO-SIGNAL, dashboard, directions as needed
- Validate CI green and health endpoints once Tooling pushes

Blockers to watch:

08:33 UTC — Policy reinforcement: Added Continuous Work Protocol. Agents must append proof-of-work every 5 minutes or log blocker + start fallback. GO-SIGNAL updated with compliance enforcement.
08:49 UTC — Posted production-readiness summary at docs/production-readiness-summary-2025-10-01.md; priorities set: P0 Dockerfile+CI, P1 CSP/MCP/RAG/Approvals, P2 Inventory/SEO/Sales. Monitor will auto-escalate non-compliance.
- Credentials (GA4/GSC/Bing) — keep features gated and degrade to mocks
- Shopify tunnel config stability for dashboard dev

08:06 UTC — Sweep executed. GO-SIGNAL timestamp updated. Quality suite run triggered. No new blockers recorded.
08:09 UTC — Sweep executed. GO-SIGNAL timestamp updated. Quality suite run triggered. No new blockers recorded.
08:11 UTC — Sweep executed. GO-SIGNAL timestamp updated. Quality suite run triggered. No new blockers recorded.
08:23 UTC — Sweep executed. GO-SIGNAL timestamp updated. Quality suite run triggered. No new blockers recorded.
08:10 UTC — Note: Dashboard test env missing dev deps (@shopify/polaris, @shopify/app-bridge-react, @faker-js/faker, bullmq, jsdom) and @prisma/client load under vitest fixtures; proceeding without installs per guardrails. Guidance requested on allowing a devDependencies install or adjusting test config to skip UI libs in server-only tests.
08:30 UTC — Decision request: Approve one of the following for test lane:
- A) Install required devDependencies (Polaris, App Bridge, jsdom, faker, bullmq) for CI test env
- B) Add Vite/vitest aliases to mock @shopify/polaris and @shopify/app-bridge-react to minimal shims; add jsdom as test environment
- C) Mark UI-heavy suites as skipped in CI and run server-only subsets green
Rationale: Server-side subsets are green; UI deps block full-run. Proceeding with server-only subsets until guidance.

08:49 UTC — Daily wrap-up (Integration Manager)
Shipped today
- MCP: connectors v1 listing across GA4/GSC/Bing with connection tests; MCP remains first; results recorded via repository
- MCP: Prisma generate before tests restored config.server tests to PASS; mismatch warning remains (prisma 5.22.0 vs client 6.16.3)
- MCP: telemetry hooks unit test PASS; added metrics endpoint at /api/mcp/metrics (JSON snapshot)
- Dashboard: server-only test subsets PASS (orders sync, sales cache, date-range, settings connection)
- Lint: dashboard at 0 errors (warnings remain); root typecheck clean
- Coordination: new notes for SEO (credentials), Inventory (readiness); blockers-log updated (credentials P1; UI test env deps Watch)

Open/blockers
- UI test env deps: @shopify/polaris, @shopify/app-bridge-react, jsdom, @faker-js/faker, bullmq (decision request at 08:30 UTC)
- Credentials: GA4/GSC/Bing pending; features mocked until provided
- Status dashboard: Approvals row update pending (format-sensitive patch); queued for next write window

Next recommendations
- Approve A/B/C path for UI test lane to unblock full dashboard test run
- Provide GA4/GSC/Bing credentials or test accounts to flip connectors to live mode
- Merge MCP telemetry metrics endpoint; wire into operations dashboard if desired
- Dashboard: capture tunnel URL and validate embedded Admin load; leave CSP/error boundary tasks on critical path

15:18 UTC — Manager task sweep
- Status dashboard: leave as-is; Approvals row update queued (format-sensitive) for next patch window.
- Assignments re-affirmed (EOD): Tooling (UI test lane Path B), SEO/Manager (Bing creds), Dashboard (tunnel capture + Admin validation), MCP (live validation after envs).
- Integration cadence: maintain 5-minute polling; brief on severity changes immediately.

## SEO & Content Intelligence — End-of-Day Update (2025-10-01)

Time: 08:06–08:50 UTC

What shipped today
- SEO UI gating: Added critical banner when no providers connected (GA4/GSC/Bing) and made connection-tests health visible with badges and a Refresh health button. UI now degrades clearly in mock mode and guides users to Settings.
- Tests: All targeted SEO tests passed (app.seo loader, api.seo report/keywords, persistence). Fixed module-resolution issue by aligning import paths and stubbing heavy UI libs in the loader test to prevent timeouts.
- Lint: Resolved an unused variable in settings repository; scoped lint clean for changed files. Remaining lint errors are outside SEO scope.

Current blockers / risks
- Credentials: GA4/GSC/Bing/MCP still outstanding for live mode. Operating in mock-first with feature gating; health endpoint will report success once secrets are added via helper scripts.
- UI test lane policy: Decision needed (install dev deps vs alias/shim vs skip UI suites) to enable broader dashboard UI test coverage beyond server-only subsets.

Next recommended steps
- Provide credentials (GA4/GSC/Bing, MCP) to enable live data and connection tests end-to-end.
- Approve test lane approach (A/B/C) so we can bring the full dashboard suite to green under CI.
- Optional: Add a Go to Settings action to the gating banner and a partial-disconnect banner when some providers are missing.

Evidence
- Code: dashboard/app/routes/app.seo.tsx (banner + refresh button), settings repo lint fix.
- Tests: targeted vitest suites passing for SEO.
- Feedback updated: feedback/seo.md (details and timestamps).

Status
- SEO track on plan; mock-mode UX is robust; ready to flip to live once creds are provided.

## RAG: Health/Metrics Verified - 2025-10-01T10:53:48-06:00
- p95 baseline: {"count": 20, "p50_ms": 4.02, "p95_ms": 16.38, "min_ms": 2.93, "max_ms": 22.22}
- Health OK, Prometheus exposed. Continuing next tasks.
## 2025-10-01T10:53:55-06:00 — Inventory status for Program Manager
- Please verify and update status dashboard for Inventory:
  - Route health 200 (mock-safe loader)
  - p95 latency plan logged (1000+ SKUs)
  - CSV export route (mock) implemented with pagination + Link header; loader test PASS
- Evidence:
  - /dashboard/app/routes/api/inventory/health.ts
  - /dashboard/app/routes/__tests__/api.inventory.health.test.ts
  - /dashboard/app/routes/api/inventory/export.csv.ts
- /dashboard/app/routes/__tests__/api.inventory.csv-export.loader.test.ts

## 2025-10-01T16:54Z — Leadership sweep: decisions and escalations

Decisions
- Approve Tooling to upload Vitest (JUnit/JSON) and ESLint (SARIF) artifacts in .github/workflows/ci.yml for PR gating.
- Accept initial SLO proposals (availability 99.9%, error rate <1%/5m, p95 latency targets). Owners to wire counters as services expose metrics.

Escalations
- Dashboard not listening on :8080 (metrics 000) — Owner: Dashboard — Action: bring service/container up to enable E2E smoke.
- Approvals SSE route 404 at /assistants/events — Owner: Approvals/Assistants — Action: implement SSE route or maintain explicit gating banner.
- MCP credentials pending (MCP_API_URL, MCP_API_KEY) — Owner: Manager — Action: provide to MCP for live validation.
- Bing credentials pending — Owner: SEO/Manager — Action: provide or confirm continued mock mode.

Status dashboard refresh
- Leaving status-dashboard.md as-is for now due to frequent write conflicts; this note reflects the current plan. Will refresh the dashboard once the write window is clear.

Next actions
- Integration: re-run health grid in 5 minutes; execute E2E smoke once dashboard is reachable.
- Tooling: add artifacts upload steps (Vitest + ESLint) and confirm with run URLs.
- Dashboard: start service on :8080 and validate /app/metrics=200.
- Approvals/Assistants: confirm SSE route readiness or gated fallback.
- SEO/Manager: supply Bing creds or keep mock flag; Manager supply MCP creds for live validation.

## 2025-10-01T11:45:59-06:00 — Inventory progress update & direction check
- Summary:
  - Inventory route health: /api/inventory/health returns 200 (test PASS)
  - p95 measurement plan for 1000+ SKUs logged (docs/inventory-performance.md)
  - CSV export (mock) implemented at /api/inventory/export.csv with pagination + Link header; loader test PASS
- Artifacts:
  - dashboard/app/routes/api/inventory/health.ts
  - dashboard/app/routes/__tests__/api.inventory.health.test.ts
  - dashboard/app/routes/api/inventory/export.csv.ts
  - dashboard/app/routes/__tests__/api.inventory.csv-export.loader.test.ts
  - docs/inventory-performance.md
- Dashboard status board now shows: “Route health 200; p95 plan logged; CSV export skeleton”.
- Next proposed steps:
  1) Add cursor-follow test to verify no duplicates/omissions across pages
  2) Prepare UI export trigger (deferred until UI integration window)
  3) Then begin wiring live Shopify inventory/orders and validate SKU/vendor mapping
- Integration risks (per integration note):
  - Dashboard not listening on :8080 (/app/metrics unreachable) — Owner: Dashboard (HIGH)
  - Approvals SSE route 404 at /assistants/events — Owner: Approvals/Assistants (MED)
  - UI test env missing dev deps (Polaris, App Bridge, jsdom, faker, bullmq) — Owner: Tooling (MED)
- Request: Please confirm direction and priority for moving from mock export to live Shopify data wiring, or advise if further test coverage should precede.

## RAG Update - 2025-10-01T11:46:20-06:00
- Health: {"status":"healthy","mode":"retrieval-only","openai_available":true}
- Ready: {"ready":true}
- Goldens: 
[1] What micron filter should I run for EFI?

[2] Return vs returnless—what should I use on a swap?

[3] What setup do I need for the Tru-Cool MAX 40K LPD4739 cooler?

[4] How do I install the Vapor Trapper vent charcoal canister to stop fuel smell?

[5] What fittings and filters do I need with the Walbro GSL392 255 LPH inline pump?

All goldens passed.
- p95 baseline (cached): {"count": 20, "p50_ms": 4.02, "p95_ms": 16.38, "min_ms": 2.93, "max_ms": 22.22}
- Background: 5m polling + 15m ingest→goldens loop active
- Next: continue stabilization, tests, MCP checks; rotate OpenAI key when available

## 2025-10-01T11:48:31-06:00 — Inventory status confirmation & next step
- Status dashboard reflects: Route health 200; p95 plan logged; CSV export skeleton.
- Artifacts (unchanged):
  - dashboard/app/routes/api/inventory/health.ts (test PASS)
  - dashboard/app/routes/api/inventory/export.csv.ts (loader test PASS)
  - docs/inventory-performance.md (p95 plan for 1000+ SKUs)
- Proposal: proceed to add cursor-follow pagination test (no duplicates/omissions), then begin live Shopify wiring for inventory/orders mapping.
- Risks (from integration notes) remain: Dashboard :8080 metrics endpoint not reachable (HIGH), Approvals SSE 404 (MED), UI test env dev deps (MED).
- Please confirm priority: after pagination test, should we advance to live wiring, or expand route/UI tests first?

## 2025-10-01T17:49Z — Leadership sweep (status + actions)

Direction & cadence
- CEO directive unchanged; 5-minute polling and proof-of-work remain in effect.
- Status dashboard inventory row reflects latest update (health 200; p95 plan; CSV export skeleton).

Health grid snapshot (read-only)
- dashboard /app/metrics: 000 (service not listening on :8080)
- rag_api /health: 200
- assistants /health: 200
- approvals /health: 200
- connectors /health: 200

Decisions (re-affirmed)
- Keep PR gating upgrade: add Vitest (JUnit/JSON) and ESLint (SARIF) artifacts to CI.
- Adopt initial SLOs (99.9% availability; <1% 5xx/5m; p95 latency targets) and wire counters as metrics become available.

Escalations (unchanged)
- Dashboard on :8080 is still down — Owner: Dashboard — Action: bring up service to enable E2E smoke.
- Approvals SSE route 404 at /assistants/events — Owner: Approvals/Assistants — Action: implement SSE route or maintain explicit gating banner.
- MCP credentials pending (MCP_API_URL/MCP_API_KEY) — Owner: Manager.
- Bing credentials pending — Owner: SEO/Manager.

Next actions
- Integration: continue 5m cadence; execute E2E smoke immediately when dashboard is reachable.
- Tooling: implement CI artifact uploads and post run URLs.
- Dashboard: start service on :8080; validate /app/metrics=200.
- Approvals/Assistants: confirm SSE route readiness or keep gated.
- Manager/SEO: provide MCP and Bing credentials as above.
