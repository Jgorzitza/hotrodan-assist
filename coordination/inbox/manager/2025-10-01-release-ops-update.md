# Release Operations Update — 2025-10-01T20:40:23-06:00

## Progress
- Release readiness matrix and GO/NO-GO draft published in `coordination/inbox/release-ops/2025-10-01-notes.md` (current stance: NO-GO due to dashboard `/app/metrics` outage, tooling shim gap, pending MCP/Bing credentials).
- Blockers logged: missing `playbooks/phase3/` checklist directory (`coordination/blockers-log.md:4117`), dashboard `/app/metrics` still 000 (`coordination/blockers-log.md:4263`), and Tooling python shim for `scripts/monitor_agents.py` (`coordination/blockers-log.md:4264`).
- Owner outreach summary circulated at `coordination/inbox/release-ops/2025-10-01-notes.md:66` requesting ETAs from Dashboard, Tooling, MCP, and Credentials.

## Outstanding Needs
1. **Dashboard:** Confirm fix ETA for `/app/metrics` + provide Cloudflare tunnel/OAuth evidence and latest lint/vitest counts once restored.
2. **Tooling:** Deliver python→python3 shim, jsdom UI test lane Path B status, and CI artifact uploads for lint/vitest.
3. **MCP:** Share timeline for env resolver merge + live validation (needs MCP_API_URL + MCP_API_KEY handoff).
4. **Credentials:** Provide Bing credential bundle and MCP secrets to clear CEO dependency list.

## Next Steps
- Monitor feedback logs for the above teams; escalate again in blockers-log if no response within 10 minutes.
- Refresh GO/NO-GO matrix immediately upon receiving dashboard metrics evidence and credential confirmations.

### Addendum — 2025-10-01T20:55:31-06:00
- Completed FastMCP bootstrap; refresh token stored locally but `scripts/fetch_mcp_token.sh` returns `invalid_refresh_token` (HTTP 400).
- Logged blocker (`coordination/blockers-log.md`) requesting new FastMCP credential bundle before live MCP validation can proceed.

### Addendum — 2025-10-01T21:53:21-06:00
- Integration smoke (21:33 MDT) failed: `/api/mcp/health` 404 (Dashboard), `/api/inventory/health` 404 (Inventory), `/assistants/events` 404 (Approvals). Blockers logged with artifact link.
- RAG health recovered (21:30 MDT grid 200/200); prior outage blocker closed.
- Tooling artifacts for Path B still missing in repo despite note; awaiting confirmation alongside python shim delivery.

### Addendum — 2025-10-01T22:33:02-06:00
- Latest health_grid.sh (22:30 MDT) timed out on `/app/metrics` (000) and showed RAG `/health` 000 while `/prometheus` 200. New service-health blockers logged for Dashboard and RAG.
- Smoke blockers unchanged: `/api/mcp/health`, `/api/inventory/health`, `/assistants/events` all still 404 on manual checks.
- Tooling artifacts (vitest + eslint JUnit) now present under test-results/dashboard/, but python shim still missing; awaiting proof.
- Evidence matrix, GO/NO-GO checklist, and morning brief updated with outstanding actions (dashboard/inventory/approvals/tooling/MCP credentials).
- Credentials: FastMCP refresh token and Bing bundle still outstanding; noted in credential watch.
