# 2025-09-29 Program Manager Briefing

## Morning Priorities
1. Launch RAG sweep if sitemap timestamps advance beyond 2025-09-27 17:58:57-06:00; otherwise skip ingest/goldens.
2. Re-run Sync & Webhooks contract verification (`npm run test:sync:webhooks`) and capture results in coordination/inbox/sync/.
3. Orders agent to reconfirm live `/sync/orders/*` wiring under USE_MOCK_DATA=false and log findings.
4. Sales, Dashboard, Settings, Inventory agents to integrate Data fixtures, run targeted Vitest suites, and append notes only.
5. Tooling + Data agents to revalidate Prisma commands and document retention cron hosting status.

## Coordination Checklist
- After each agent posts notes, update `coordination/status-dashboard.md` and `coordination/blockers-log.md`.
- If Shopify CLI tunnel remains broken, document the failure mode and escalate to DevOps for support.
- Confirm no agent edits prompts/summaries; all changes stay under `coordination/inbox/` per agent.

## Blockers to Track
- Live analytics feed activation (Sales/Data) — pending service URL.
- Settings credentials (GA4/GSC/Bing) — still outstanding.
- Shopify CLI tunnel module-resolution issue — needs resolution before dashboard deep-link smoke tests.

## Notes
- Path blocks + instruction blocks prepared for every agent (see manager playbook). Paste path block first, then instructions, to eliminate file search overhead.
- Manager owns all updates to shared docs; agents only append to their notes.

## Retro / Improvements
- Wrong repository context at start burned time; always confirm `pwd` + repo before following AGENT_COMMANDS.
- Agents were given open-ended instructions that led to editing shared prompts/docs; tighten launches with explicit "notes-only" rule.
- Path typos caused repeated file-search churn; standardize launch process (paste Paths block, then Instructions) and maintain `manager-launch-commands.txt`.
- Dashboard CLI tunnel issue lingered without escalation path; next session, flag infra blockers immediately in blockers log + ping DevOps.
- Sync/Orders coordination relied on oral updates; capture every contract change directly in `coordination/2025-09-27_orders-sync-contract.md` as it happens.

## Cleanup Actions (2025-09-29)
- Removed unused dashboard artifacts: `tsconfig.paths.temp`, `sales-demo.html`, redundant live data doc, and the obsolete `dev-with-env.sh` script.
- Dropped redundant orders extended test to keep vitest suite streamlined.
- Cleared Python `__pycache__` directories and stale `status-dashboard.md.backup` to reduce noise.
- Added dashboard tunnel blocker entry to `coordination/blockers-log.md`.
- Reminder: run `npm run lint`, `npx vitest --run --root dashboard` (targeted suites), and `npm run prisma:generate` after cleanup to confirm no regressions.
