# Dashboard Engineer — End-of-Day Update (2025-10-01)

Time window: 07:20–08:58 UTC

What shipped today
- Live dev tunnel captured and applied
  - Tunnel: https://oxide-ordered-projector-hills.trycloudflare.com
  - Updated application_url and [auth].redirect_urls in shopify.app.toml and dashboard/shopify.app.toml
  - Evidence: coordination/inbox/dashboard/current_tunnel_url.txt, dev.log
- Dev server running with Shopify CLI
  - Proxy + GraphiQL started; CLI dev active under background PID in coordination/inbox/dashboard/dev.pid
- Prisma startup error fixed for dev
  - Error was DIRECT_URL missing under PostgreSQL schema
  - Fix: prisma.config.ts now selects prisma/schema.sqlite.prisma when DATABASE_URL starts with file:
  - Added dashboard/.env.local with DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db
  - Dev restarted; pre-dev prisma generate OK
- Guardrail for Shopify GraphQL mutations (safety)
  - Central wrapper blocks Admin API mutations unless variables.conversationId matches the saved ID
  - Saved conversationId: coordination/shopify/conversation_id.txt (6c8af002-861c-4f9b-991f-5c8f70770500)
- Five-minute polling started
  - PID: contents of coordination/inbox/dashboard/polling.pid
  - Log: coordination/inbox/dashboard/polling.log (snapshots of GO-SIGNAL and direction)
- Lint + unit test evidence captured
  - Server-only subset green (4 files, 12 tests all passed)
  - Lint: warnings remain; a few unused variable errors called out in app._index.tsx and app.sales.tsx

Evidence
- coordination/inbox/dashboard/2025-10-01-notes.md (commands, outputs, probes)
- coordination/inbox/dashboard/dev.log, dev.pid
- coordination/inbox/dashboard/polling.log, polling.pid
- feedback/dashboard.md (summary)

Risks / blockers
- Partners App configuration: CLI reports “Update URLs: Not yet configured.” TOML has been updated locally and dev tunnel is live; recommend confirming App URL and Allowed redirection URL(s) in Partners to match the tunnel. If needed, approve a window to sync settings via CLI or UI.
- Live analytics: GA4/GSC/Bing credentials outstanding; SEO/Sales analytics remain in mock mode until provided.

Next actions (proposed for tomorrow)
- Validate embedded Admin end-to-end (OAuth completes; embedded UI renders); capture logs and HTTP evidence
- Confirm Partners App Setup reflects the tunnel URL and /auth/callback redirect
- Reduce dashboard lint errors (unused symbol cleanup in app._index.tsx and app.sales.tsx)
- If credentials are provided, flip gates to live mode and run connection tests
