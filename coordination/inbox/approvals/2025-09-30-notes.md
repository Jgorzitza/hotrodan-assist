- Completed Tasks 1-25 from OVERNIGHT_TASKS.md covering API docs, schema catalog, deployment/config guides, troubleshooting, user/developer guides, architecture overview, integration plans, testing strategies, and deployment/operations runbooks.
- All deliverables stored under docs/approvals/ with README index.

- Added `docs/approvals/security-hardening-roadmap.md` outlining phased security upgrades (auth/RBAC, DB migration, monitoring, incident response).

- Standing by for new directives or green light to execute roadmap items.
