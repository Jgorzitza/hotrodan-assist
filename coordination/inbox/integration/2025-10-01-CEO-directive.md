# CEO Directive Broadcast — 2025-10-01T15:58Z

Audience: All agents (Tooling, Dashboard, MCP, Sales, Inventory, SEO, RAG, Approvals, Manager)

Directive
- Resume the 5-minute polling cadence immediately.
- Poll the manager-owned signal and notes on each cycle.

Where to look
- Production Today — Priority Override (2025-10-01)
- CEO Dependencies — Today
- CEO directive is logged in integration/manager notes

Poll these each cycle
- coordination/GO-SIGNAL.md
- coordination/status-dashboard.md
- coordination/inbox/* (integration and manager notes)
- your team’s direction file (read-only): plans/agents/<team>/direction.md

Current work context (Tooling/Dashboard)
- EnhancedAnalyticsDashboard.tsx migrated to Polaris v12 APIs. Major changes:
  - Replaced deprecated stacks (BlockBlockStack→BlockStack, InlineBlockStack→InlineStack)
  - Text now uses `as` and `tone` where required; Badge uses `tone` and string children
  - Modal uses `size="large"`; added `isLoading` to local state
  - Added a minimal local enhanced analytics service/types to satisfy tsc
- Dashboard tests: PASS (46 files, 203 tests).
- ESLint: 0 errors (2 non-blocking warnings).
- TypeScript: Remaining errors exist in app._index.tsx, app.orders.tsx, app.inventory.tsx and a few mocks/util files (expected Polaris v12 prop updates and minor nits). Planned next migrations are queued.

Next steps
- Continue 5-minute polling with proof-of-work appends.
- Tooling to proceed with Polaris v12 updates in app/_index.tsx, app/orders.tsx, app/inventory.tsx.
- Owners should update coordination notes with risk/owner/deadline if a dependency blocks progress.
