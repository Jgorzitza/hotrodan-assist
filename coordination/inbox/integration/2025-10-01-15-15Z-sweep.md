# Integration Sweep — 2025-10-01T15:15Z

- GO-SIGNAL: High-velocity mode active; Implementation Directive to run scripts/prepare_dashboard_dev.sh noted. Critical Path unchanged (Tooling, Dashboard, MCP all DOING).
- Dashboard tests: All suites green (46 files, 203 tests). Stabilized test env by normalizing TextEncoder/TextDecoder and URL/URLSearchParams; removed empty test file warning.
- Lint: 0 errors, 2 warnings (non-blocking).
- TypeScript (tsc --noEmit): surfaced UI type errors (Polaris v12 API updates required: Text 'as' prop, Badge tone/children type, Card.Section removals, deprecated/changed props; plus small type fixes in tests and helpers). Plan:
  1) Migrate EnhancedAnalyticsDashboard.tsx to Polaris v12 props.
  2) Update app._index.tsx, app.orders.tsx, app.inventory.tsx for Polaris v12 props.
  3) Address minor type nits (URLSearchParamsInit, optional chaining, test types).
- Credentials: GA4/GSC provided; Bing pending (Watch). Features remain gated until Bing arrives.
- Shopify CLI tunnel: Pending Partners app application_url/redirect confirmation; script can assist. Owner: Dashboard. Deadline: +30m.
- Owners & deadlines:
  - Dashboard lint/ts cleanup — Owner: Tooling — Target: EOD
  - Partners app URL/redirect verification — Owner: Dashboard — Target: +30m
  - Bing creds — Owner: Manager/SEO — Target: EOD
- Evidence: vitest run output and lint results appended to feedback/tooling.md.
- Next check-in: +5m; proceed with Polaris migration (EnhancedAnalyticsDashboard.tsx) and re-run tsc.
