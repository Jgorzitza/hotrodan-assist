# 2025-10-01 Integration Notes

## Integration Manager — Sweep 2025-10-01T07:40Z
- GO-SIGNAL: High-velocity cadence assumed; continue 5-minute polling
- Approvals: Lightweight readiness checks recorded; ASSISTANTS_BASE required; approvals notes written and dashboard update attempted
- Dashboard: Prior results stand (lint errors remain; 30/31 tests passing); manual tunnel capture still pending for Admin validation
- MCP: Targeted tests in mock mode passing
- Risks: R1 TypeScript drift P2 (unchanged), R2 Credentials P1 (unchanged), R3 Analytics contract P2 (unchanged)
- Actions: feedback/approvals.md appended; coordination/inbox/approvals/2025-10-01-notes.md created
- Next check-in: next polling cycle (5 minutes)

## Integration Manager — Sweep 2025-10-01T07:59Z

## Integration Manager — Sweep 2025-10-01T08:15Z
- MCP config.server retest: PASS after prisma generate (2 tests). Mismatch warning remains (prisma 5.22.0 vs client 6.16.3) but generation ok.
- Status dashboard Approvals row update: will retry with synchronized exact-line match next sweep (format shifts observed earlier today).
- Next: Continue targeted non-UI dashboard subsets and append deltas; no idle.

## Integration Manager — Sweep 2025-10-01T08:20Z
- Dashboard server-side subset: PASS (4 files, 32 tests). Cache, date-range, orders sync, and connection tests all green.
- Dashboard UI deps remain missing in test env (Polaris, App Bridge, jsdom, faker, bullmq). Not installing deps per guardrails; evidence logged in feedback.
- Approvals row update still queued; will apply with re-synced block next sweep.

## Integration Manager — Sweep 2025-10-01T08:24Z

## Integration Manager — Sweep 2025-10-01T08:29Z
- Tooling: CI lane expanded; prisma generate before MCP tests; artifacts produced. Owner: Tooling. Deadline: EOD
- Dashboard: /api/health added; mocks histogram test to fix; CSP hardening pending. Owner: Dashboard. Deadline: EOD
- MCP: breaker/rate limit/pooling + registry tests green; next expose metrics to routes. Owner: MCP. Deadline: EOD
- RAG: persistence/caching p95 targets queued. Owner: RAG. Deadline: EOD
- Risks: Credentials (GA4/GSC/Bing) P1 remain; features stay in mock mode until provided. Mitigation: gate and banner
- Blockers-log: appended two status rows for credentials (P1) and dashboard UI test env deps (Watch), pointing to feedback evidence.
- Continuing with targeted test subsets; status dashboard update queued for next patch.
- Tooling: Root tests (app/tests) 4 files, 12 tests, all passed (983ms). Switched to vitest run to avoid watch ELOOP on symlinked bin tree.
- Dashboard: Lint now shows 12 warnings, 0 errors; failing mocks histogram test remains outstanding.
- Approvals: Row update in status dashboard will be retried next sweep after re-parse.
- Risks unchanged (R1=P2, R2=P1, R3=P2).
- Next check-in: next polling cycle (5 minutes).

## Integration Manager — Sweep 2025-10-01T08:36Z
- GO-SIGNAL: High-velocity mode remains active; last updated 08:23 UTC, next sweep 08:28 UTC
- Status dashboard: MCP row aligned (DOING); critical path items match direction: rate limit/retry, timeouts/pooling, error tracking, SLO dashboards
- Blockers: GA4/GSC credentials confirmed provided; Bing still pending (Watch); Dashboard UI test env deps at Watch; CLI tunnel issue Open
- Mitigation owners & deadlines:
  - Credentials (Bing) — Owner: Manager/SEO — Deadline: EOD — Action: provide env or test account; keep feature gated
  - Dashboard UI deps — Owner: Tooling — Deadline: EOD — Action: ensure dev deps available in test env or skip UI suites in CI lane
  - CLI tunnel failure — Owner: Dashboard — Deadline: EOD — Action: capture tunnel, verify shopify.app.toml, run lint/unit suite
- MCP live validation: Ready to execute when MCP_API_URL and MCP_API_KEY are provided; test harness in place; will log outcome
- Next check-in: +5 minutes; continue direction tasks; no idle

## Integration Manager — Sweep 2025-10-01T08:38Z
- Settings: Executed GA4/GSC connection tests using stored credentials; recorded summaries via repository for demo-shop.myshopify.com
- Evidence: dashboard/app/lib/settings/__tests__/live-cred-check.test.ts (1 test) — PASS
- Blockers-log: appended row marking GA4/GSC provided; Bing pending
- Next: await Bing creds; proceed with MCP live validation when provided

# 🚀 GO-SIGNAL — High-Velocity Mode Active (2025-10-01)

Last Updated: 2025-10-01 08:23 UTC • Next Sweep: 08:28 UTC

Project root (canonical): /home/justin/llama_rag

## Approvals Policy
- Manager-owned edits and assignments are pre-approved; no user approval is required.
- Do not wait for ad-hoc instructions. Poll every 5 minutes and proceed.

## Immediate Actions (Critical Path)
1) Tooling — Production Pipeline (DOING)
   - Containerize services; CI/CD; health checks; monitoring/alerts
2) Dashboard — Live Data Integration (DOING)
   - Remove USE_MOCK_DATA; wire live MCP; error boundaries; CSP
3) MCP — Production Monitoring (DOING)
   - Rate limit/retry; timeouts/pooling; error tracking; SLO dashboards

## Polling Commands (run every 5 minutes)
```bash
ls -la coordination/GO-SIGNAL.md coordination/AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md || true
head -40 plans/agents/[your-agent]/direction.md || true
```

## Report Progress
- Append to feedback/[your-agent].md every 5 minutes with proof-of-work (diff/test/artifact) or blocker + fallback started.
- If blocked, state the blocker and proceed with fallback tasks from your direction file.

## Compliance Enforcement
- If no proof-of-work appears in feedback within 10 minutes, the cycle is marked non-compliant and escalated in blockers-log.
- Continuous work is mandatory: pick the next task immediately from “Next 5 Tasks” in your direction.
- Automation: A scheduled monitor (Agent Proof Monitor) runs every 5 minutes to enforce proof-of-work and append escalations automatically.
