- MCP config.server retest: PASS after prisma generate (2 tests). Mismatch warning remains (prisma 5.22.0 vs client 6.16.3) but generation ok.
- Status dashboard Approvals row update: will retry with synchronized exact-line match next sweep (format shifts observed earlier today).
- Next: Continue targeted non-UI dashboard subsets and append deltas; no idle.
- Tooling: Root tests (app/tests) 4 files, 12 tests, all passed (983ms). Switched to vitest run to avoid watch ELOOP on symlinked bin tree.
- Dashboard: Lint now shows 12 warnings, 0 errors; failing mocks histogram test remains outstanding.
- Approvals: Row update in status dashboard will be retried next sweep after re-parse.
- Risks unchanged (R1=P2, R2=P1, R3=P2).
- Next check-in: next polling cycle (5 minutes).
