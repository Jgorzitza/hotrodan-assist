## Integration Manager — Sweep 2025-10-01T08:15Z
- MCP config.server retest: PASS after prisma generate (2 tests). Mismatch warning remains (prisma 5.22.0 vs client 6.16.3) but generation ok.
- Status dashboard Approvals row update: will retry with synchronized exact-line match next sweep (format shifts observed earlier today).
- Next: Continue targeted non-UI dashboard subsets and append deltas; no idle.

## Integration Manager — Sweep 2025-10-01T08:20Z
- Dashboard server-side subset: PASS (4 files, 32 tests). Cache, date-range, orders sync, and connection tests all green.
- Dashboard UI deps remain missing in test env (Polaris, App Bridge, jsdom, faker, bullmq). Not installing deps per guardrails; evidence logged in feedback.
- Approvals row update still queued; will apply with re-synced block next sweep.

- Blockers-log: appended two status rows for credentials (P1) and dashboard UI test env deps (Watch), pointing to feedback evidence.
- Continuing with targeted test subsets; status dashboard update queued for next patch.
- Tooling: Root tests (app/tests) 4 files, 12 tests, all passed (983ms). Switched to vitest run to avoid watch ELOOP on symlinked bin tree.
- Dashboard: Lint now shows 12 warnings, 0 errors; failing mocks histogram test remains outstanding.
- Approvals: Row update in status dashboard will be retried next sweep after re-parse.
- Risks unchanged (R1=P2, R2=P1, R3=P2).
- Next check-in: next polling cycle (5 minutes).
