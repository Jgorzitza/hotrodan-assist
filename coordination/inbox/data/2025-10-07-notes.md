# 2025-10-07 Data Agent Notes

## Updates
- Logged the retention index migration (`20251006121500_add_retention_indexes`) in the database prompt and Prisma config rollout plan; reinforced retention cron readiness while we await infra selection.
- Revalidated Prisma client generation + SQLite sync after the index migration so the retention cron job keeps an indexed path locally.

## Tests
- `npm run prisma:generate`
- `DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.sqlite" npm run prisma:db-push:sqlite`

## Next
- Hold for Ops decision on Fly vs Render before wiring `/cron/retention` in staging; plan to rerun the retention Vitest suite once deployment picks up the new migration.
- Immediate focus: deliver the Shopify analytics response shape + fixtures to unblock Sales/Overview (Gate B).
