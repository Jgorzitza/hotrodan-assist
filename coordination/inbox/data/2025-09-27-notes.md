# 2025-09-27 Data Agent Notes

## Next
- Deliver the Shopify analytics response shape + fixtures so Sales/Dashboard can swap off mocks (Gate B).
- Once fixtures are shared, update docs/prompts and rerun the Prisma-backed Settings suite after any seed tweaks; log results here.
- After Ops selects a host, rerun retention tests once staging picks up the migration and document the cron rollout steps.

## Coordination
- Inventory planner route now consumes `calculateTrendStats` from `app/lib/inventory/math.ts` (see dashboard/app/lib/inventory/math.ts:1-91). Please keep the upcoming analytics trend payload aligned with the `{ label: string; units: number }` structure so the helper can ingest it without reshaping. Flag any schema changes before they land.
- 2025-09-27 18:35 MDT â€” Settings agent needs the GA4/GSC/Bing credential handoff bundle plus MCP endpoint/key expectations so we can flip `USE_MOCK_DATA=false` in staging; please include updated Prisma seeds when ready so we can rerun the settings Vitest suites and log results.
