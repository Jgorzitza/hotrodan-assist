# 2025-09-27 Data Agent Notes

## Next
- Deliver the Shopify analytics response shape + fixtures so Sales/Dashboard can swap off mocks (Gate B).
- Once fixtures are shared, update docs/prompts and rerun the Prisma-backed Settings suite after any seed tweaks; log results here.
- After Ops selects a host, rerun retention tests once staging picks up the migration and document the cron rollout steps.

## Coordination
- Inventory planner route now consumes `calculateTrendStats` from `app/lib/inventory/math.ts` (see dashboard/app/lib/inventory/math.ts:1-91). Please keep the upcoming analytics trend payload aligned with the `{ label: string; units: number }` structure so the helper can ingest it without reshaping. Flag any schema changes before they land.
- 2025-09-27 18:35 MDT — Settings agent needs the GA4/GSC/Bing credential handoff bundle plus MCP endpoint/key expectations so we can flip `USE_MOCK_DATA=false` in staging; please include updated Prisma seeds when ready so we can rerun the settings Vitest suites and log results.

## 2025-09-27 Data & Prisma Agent Work

### Completed Tasks
1. **Published Shopify Analytics Response Shape & Fixtures**
   - ✅ Analytics response types defined in `app/types/analytics.ts`
   - ✅ Comprehensive fixtures available in `app/mocks/fixtures/analytics.sales.ts`
   - ✅ Response mapping implemented in `app/lib/sales/analytics.server.ts`
   - ✅ Test coverage verified (4/4 tests passing)

2. **Prisma & Analytics Tests**
   - ✅ `npm run prisma:generate` completed successfully
   - ✅ Analytics server tests passing (`npx vitest run app/lib/sales/__tests__/analytics.server.test.ts`)
   - ✅ Prisma client generated successfully

### Analytics Implementation Status
- **Response Contract**: Complete and published
  - `AnalyticsSalesResponse` type with comprehensive field coverage
  - Support for base, warning, empty, and error scenarios
  - Proper money/currency handling with multiple field name variations
  - Collections, products, variants, and insights structures

- **Fixtures**: Complete and ready
  - 4 scenario fixtures (base, warning, empty, error)
  - Realistic mock data with proper relationships
  - Currency formatting and date normalization

- **Integration Points**: Ready for Sales/Dashboard
  - `fetchSalesAnalytics()` function with proper error handling
  - `mapAnalyticsResponse()` for data transformation
  - Caching layer implemented in `cache.server.ts`
  - Environment variable configuration (`ANALYTICS_SERVICE_URL`)

### Identified Gaps & Blockers
1. **Analytics Service Endpoint**: 
   - ❌ `ANALYTICS_SERVICE_URL` environment variable not configured
   - ❌ Live analytics service not yet deployed
   - ✅ Mock data fallback working via `USE_MOCK_DATA=true`

2. **Shopify Admin Integration**:
   - ✅ `withStoreSession` helper implemented
   - ✅ GraphQL query builders ready (`app/lib/shopify/queries.ts`)
   - ✅ Rate limiting and retry logic implemented
   - ⚠️ KMS integration still TODO (using fallback decryption)

3. **Prisma Schema**:
   - ✅ Schema generated successfully
   - ✅ Store model with access token encryption
   - ✅ Connection event tracking implemented

### Next Steps for Sales/Dashboard Team
1. Set `ANALYTICS_SERVICE_URL` environment variable when analytics service is deployed
2. Use `fetchSalesAnalytics()` function from `~/lib/sales/analytics.server`
3. Fixtures available via `analyticsSalesFixtures` for testing
4. Cache layer handles TTL and key management automatically

### Test Results
- Prisma generation: ✅ Success
- Analytics tests: ✅ 4/4 passing
- Type safety: ✅ Full TypeScript coverage
- Mock data: ✅ All scenarios working

**Status**: Analytics contract published and ready for Sales/Dashboard consumption. Blocked on analytics service deployment.
