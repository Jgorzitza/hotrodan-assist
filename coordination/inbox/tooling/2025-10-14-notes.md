# 2025-10-14 Tooling Agent Notes

## Done
- Revalidated the Prisma CLI workflow trio (`npm run prisma:generate`, SQLite `db push --force-reset`, `db seed`) on `feature/route-sales-drilldown` with all commands loading defaults from `prisma.config.ts`; recorded results in `coordination/2025-09-26_prisma-config-plan.md`.
- Noted that the post-Oct 1 CI smoke remains pending until this branch lands on `main`.

## Next
- Coordinate with DevOps to trigger the post-Oct 1 CI smoke after merge and log the pipeline outcome in the plan doc.
