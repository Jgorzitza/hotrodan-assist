2025-10-01T15:55:41Z — Patched app.seo.prisma test to stub MCP client (avoids telemetry require). Vitest loaders+prisma PASS (2/2).

[2025-10-01T23:13:00Z] [manager] SEO/Sales: keep fallback work (tests + gating) moving; mint new MCP tokens with scripts/fetch_mcp_token.sh when ready for live checks and log token length in notes.
