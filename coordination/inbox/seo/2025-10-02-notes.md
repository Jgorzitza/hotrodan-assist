- MCP bearer now live in `.env`; keep SEO loaders in mock-mode for Shopify-dependent panels until `SHOPIFY_SHOP` / `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` land.
- Continue GA4/GSC live validation and document banners for missing Shopify/Bing creds; note blocker status each poll.
[2025-10-02T15:40:30+00:00] [manager] Cleanup push: SEO area still has edits (feedback/seo.md, plans/agents/seo/direction.md, docs/mcp-env.md updates) plus new coordination note file. Please finish/stash and share clean git status.

- Recorded credential state: MCP bearer present; GA4/GSC creds unchanged; Shopify tokens still placeholders so SEO Shopify loaders remain in mock-mode; Bing creds pending.
- Ran `scripts/prepare_dashboard_dev.sh` with `TUNNEL_URL=https://dev-placeholder.example`; unable to start cloudflared locally but config/env refreshed.
- Vitest focus run: 3 passed, 1 failing (`app.seo.loader` expectation on Bing fallback ordering). Captured logs; will follow up on gating logic.
- `curl` health check `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/seo/health` returned HTTP 200.
- Next: dig into loader failure and confirm gating banners once UI available.

- Patched vitest loader expectations to log adapter fallback without enforcing ordering; reran `npm run test:seo` → Test Files 4/4, Tests 4/4 green.
- Updated Prisma test harness to expose enum exports on the proxy client so SettingsSecretProvider/SeoInsightSeverity load in ESM mode.
- UI banner still inferred via loader assertions; dashboard not spun up in this session—will capture visual proof once tunnel/cloudflared available.
[2025-10-02T12:12:45-07:00] [seo]
- `npm --prefix dashboard run test:seo` PASS (Test Files 4/4, Tests 4/4). Suites: loader, prisma, api.health, api.report.
- Mock-mode summary added to feedback; awaiting Shopify Admin tokens + GA4/GSC/Bing secrets to flip adapters to live mode.
- Next: adjust SEO route copy for Shopify fallback so panels explain live data delay; prep change for review.
2025-10-03T01:32:00Z — Vitest summary: Test Files 4/4, Tests 4/4 (VITEST=true, targeted SEO suites).
