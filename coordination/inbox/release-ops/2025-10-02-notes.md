[2025-10-02T15:36:49Z] [tooling] Adopted playbooks/phase3/cleanup.md alongside commands/cleanup-and-merge.md for repo hygiene sweeps. Please reference both in next cleanup cycle and confirm once your worktree is clean so manager can re-run the canonical merge.

- Commands doc now links directly to playbooks/phase3/cleanup.md; please follow the playbook guardrails (targeted staging, proof logging) on next cleanup run. Ping once release ops worktree is clean for canonical merge scheduling.
### 2025-10-02T12:12:23-06:00 — Status Sweep
- Shopify Admin credentials still pending (SHOPIFY_SHOP / SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN placeholders per manager template); awaiting CEO handoff before live validation can proceed.
- Outstanding blockers: cleanup proof gate (Dashboard/Inventory/Approvals/Tooling/MCP), dashboard runtime env preventing `/api/inventory/health` 200, Integration smoke paused, Bing credentials outstanding.
- Teams owing proof-of-work: Dashboard (live tests + git status), MCP (live vitest with new token), Tooling (clean tree + python shim), plus inventory curl once runtime returns.
- Ran `bash scripts/fetch_mcp_token.sh` after `npx -y mcp-remote@latest https://tired-green-ladybug.fastmcp.app/mcp`; token length 781 (no secrets logged).

#### GO/NO-GO Evidence — 2025-10-02T12:12 MDT
| Item | Status | Last Proof | Owner / Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/app/metrics` | ✅ 200 | scripts/health_grid.sh (2025-10-02T10:42 MDT, rerun 12:12 MDT) | Dashboard to keep watchdog running |
| `/api/mcp/health` | ⏳ Pending 200 curl + live vitest | Awaiting Dashboard/MCP proof with fresh token (no recent timestamp) | Dashboard + MCP to rerun live suite |
| `/api/inventory/health` | ⏳ dev runtime offline (404) | Inventory notes (2025-10-02T09:15 MDT build pass) | Dashboard to restore env + share curl 200 |
| Vitest suites (Dashboard Path B) | ✅ Mock mode pass (2025-10-02T14:38 UTC) | Dashboard lint/vitest logs | Dashboard to rerun live ENABLE_MCP once env ready |
| Approvals SSE `/assistants/events` | ⏳ Awaiting harness proof | Approvals automation logs (15:30 UTC no change) | Approvals to restart service + capture curl/harness |
| Tooling cleanup proof | ⏳ git status pending | Tooling inbox (2025-10-02T09:27 MDT adoption) | Tooling to post git status + shim output |
| Credentials watch | MCP ✅ (token len 781 @12:12 MDT); Shopify/Bing ⏳ | Release Ops notes | Manager/CEO to deliver remaining secrets |
[2025-10-02T20:31:11-06:00] [integration] Reminder: Please post FastMCP token-length evidence (run scripts/fetch_mcp_token.sh and log bearer length, e.g., ~781 chars) per docs/mcp-env.md. This unblocks live validation + E2E gating.
