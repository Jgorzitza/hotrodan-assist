[2025-09-29T10:52:43-0600] ITEM 1 ANALYSIS: Contract/e2e suites for top flows
[2025-09-29T10:52:43-0600] CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT:
[2025-09-29T10:52:43-0600] - Unit tests: 49 tests passing (inventory-math, webhook-signature, inventory-analytics, inventory-performance)
[2025-09-29T10:52:43-0600] - Integration tests: 3 tests passing (action-handler, orders-loader)
[2025-09-29T10:52:43-0600] - E2E tests: 3 tests SKIPPED (smoke.spec.ts requires PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL)
[2025-09-29T10:52:43-0600] - Python tests: Multiple test files exist but not integrated into CI
[2025-09-29T10:52:48-0600] CRITICAL FLOWS IDENTIFIED:
[2025-09-29T10:52:48-0600] 1. RAG API (app/rag_api/main.py) - Core search and retrieval
[2025-09-29T10:52:48-0600] 2. Sync Service (app/sync/main.py) - Zoho/Shopify data integration
[2025-09-29T10:52:48-0600] 3. Assistants API (app/assistants/main.py) - Inbox and delivery system
[2025-09-29T10:52:48-0600] 4. Dashboard (dashboard/) - Frontend user interface
[2025-09-29T10:52:48-0600] 5. SEO API (app/seo-api/) - SEO optimization services
[2025-09-29T10:52:52-0600] GAPS IDENTIFIED:
[2025-09-29T10:52:52-0600] 1. NO E2E tests for RAG API endpoints (search, query, health)
[2025-09-29T10:52:52-0600] 2. NO E2E tests for Sync Service (webhook processing, data sync)
[2025-09-29T10:52:52-0600] 3. NO E2E tests for Assistants API (inbox, delivery, persistence)
[2025-09-29T10:52:52-0600] 4. NO contract tests for API interfaces between services
[2025-09-29T10:52:52-0600] 5. NO E2E tests for complete user journeys (search -> result -> action)
[2025-09-29T10:52:52-0600] 6. Dashboard E2E tests are SKIPPED due to missing configuration
[2025-09-29T10:52:58-0600] PROPOSED FIXES (FEEDBACK TO DEV TEAM):
[2025-09-29T10:52:58-0600] 1. Create contract tests for RAG API endpoints:
[2025-09-29T10:52:58-0600]    - GET /health endpoint contract
[2025-09-29T10:52:58-0600]    - POST /query endpoint contract with request/response schemas
[2025-09-29T10:52:58-0600]    - GET /search endpoint contract
[2025-09-29T10:52:58-0600] 2. Create E2E tests for critical user flows:
[2025-09-29T10:52:58-0600]    - Complete search flow: query -> results -> display
[2025-09-29T10:52:58-0600]    - Data sync flow: webhook -> processing -> storage
[2025-09-29T10:52:58-0600]    - Assistant flow: message -> processing -> response
[2025-09-29T10:52:58-0600] 3. Fix E2E test configuration:
[2025-09-29T10:52:58-0600]    - Set PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL environment variable
[2025-09-29T10:52:58-0600]    - Configure test database and services
[2025-09-29T10:52:58-0600] 4. Integrate Python tests into CI pipeline
[2025-09-29T10:52:58-0600] 5. Create API contract validation tests between services
