STATUS: ✅ Phase 3 validation complete. Continuous monitoring active.

KEY DELIVERABLES:
✓ feedback/quality.md — Comprehensive Phase 3 results and recommendations
✓ coordination/inbox/quality/security-performance-report-2025-10-01.md — Detailed security/performance analysis
✓ scripts/continuous-monitor.sh — Automated monitoring script (7 checks)
✓ playbooks/phase3/* — Staged validation playbooks (10 domains)
✓ coordination/inventory/quality-manifest.md — Quality command reference

QUALITY GATES (ALL PASSED):
✓ TypeScript/Lint: PASS
✓ Unit/Integration: 12/12 tests
✓ RAG Goldens: ALL PASS
✓ E2E Smoke: 0 failures (3 skipped/conditional)

SECURITY FINDINGS:
⚠ 5 moderate npm vulnerabilities (esbuild→vite→vitest chain)
  └─ Recommendation: Accept risk (dev-only; not in prod bundle)
✓ No critical/high vulnerabilities

PERFORMANCE FINDINGS:
⚠ 14,903 code debt markers (TODO/FIXME/HACK)
  └─ Action: Categorize and create burndown plan
ℹ️ 178M node_modules (moderate; within normal range)
ℹ️ 5 large files (handover bundles, chroma backups)
  └─ Action: Archive/gitignore non-essential artifacts

MONITORING ACTIVE:
• Script: scripts/continuous-monitor.sh
• Logs: coordination/inbox/quality/<date>-monitor.log
• Checks: npm audit, TypeScript, large files, disk, debt, git status
• Run: bash scripts/continuous-monitor.sh (manual or cron)

BLOCKERS:
1. Analytics credentials (GA4/GSC/Bing) — blocks playbook 80
2. Shopify tunnel URL — blocks playbook 70

NEXT ACTIONS FOR MANAGER:
□ Review npm audit remediation strategy (accept risk vs upgrade vitest@3)
□ Approve tech-debt burndown allocation (~10% sprint time)
□ Prioritize analytics credential provisioning
□ Assign large file cleanup to Tooling

NEXT ACTIONS FOR QUALITY:
□ Maintain 5-minute polling cadence
□ Re-run validation suite post-npm-audit decision
□ Execute playbook 40-security.sh when authorized
□ Monitor continuous-monitor.sh logs for alerts
