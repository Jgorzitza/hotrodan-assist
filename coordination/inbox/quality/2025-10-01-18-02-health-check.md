# Quality Agent — Health Check & Blocker Validation (2025-10-01T18:02Z)

## Session Info
- **Time**: 18:00-18:02 UTC
- **Trigger**: User directive "Check manager updates and get to work"
- **Context**: Resuming after EOD report delivery

## Manager Update Poll Results
- **GO-SIGNAL**: 15:58 UTC (no changes)
- **Quality Direction**: Does not exist
- **Status Dashboard**: Read (TODO agents not updated with EOD work)
- **Blockers Log**: Read (new integration blockers at 16:54Z)
- **New Manager Notes**: None since 17:45 UTC

## Service Health Validation (18:01-18:02 UTC)

### ✅ HEALTHY Services

#### 1. RAG API (Port 8001)
- **Health Response**: `{"status":"healthy","mode":"retrieval-only","openai_available":true}`
- **Docker Status**: "Up 9 hours (unhealthy)" ⚠️
- **Analysis**: Docker healthcheck misconfigured; service actually healthy
- **Impact**: Low - service operational, false positive on Docker status
- **Recommendation**: Fix Docker healthcheck configuration (P2)

#### 2. Approvals UI (Port 5173)  
- **Health Response**: `{"status":"ok","ts":"2025-10-01T18:01:22+00:00"}`
- **Status**: Running as standalone process (not Docker)
- **Performance**: All checks passing per logs
- **Impact**: None - fully operational

### ❌ BLOCKED Services

#### 3. Dashboard (Port 8080)
- **Test**: `curl http://localhost:8080/app/metrics`
- **Result**: NOT REACHABLE
- **Analysis**: Service not listening on port 8080
- **Blocker Source**: Integration blocker logged at 16:54Z
- **Owner**: Dashboard
- **Impact**: High - metrics endpoint unavailable
- **Status**: Confirms existing blocker

#### 4. Assistants SSE (/assistants/events)
- **Test**: `curl http://localhost:8002/assistants/events`
- **Result**: `{"detail":"Not Found"}` (404)
- **Analysis**: Route not implemented or incorrect path
- **Blocker Source**: Integration blocker logged at 16:54Z  
- **Owner**: Approvals/Assistants
- **Impact**: Medium - SSE streaming unavailable
- **Status**: Confirms existing blocker

## Docker Container Analysis
```
NAMES                      STATUS                   PORTS
llama_rag-rag-api-1        Up 9 hours (unhealthy)   0.0.0.0:8001->8001/tcp
```

**Findings**:
- Only RAG API containerized
- Dashboard, Approvals, Assistants not in Docker
- Services running as standalone processes

**Implications**:
- Dashboard not containerized yet (Tooling in progress per critical path)
- Current architecture: mixed (some Docker, some standalone)
- Production pipeline work (Tooling) likely addressing this

## Blocker Confirmation Matrix

| Blocker | Reported | Validated | Owner | Status | Priority |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Dashboard :8080 not listening | 16:54Z | 18:01Z ✅ | Dashboard | Open | P1 |
| Assistants SSE 404 | 16:54Z | 18:01Z ✅ | Approvals/Assistants | Watch | P2 |
| RAG Docker unhealthy | 18:01Z | 18:01Z ✅ | RAG | Watch | P3 |

## Critical Path Status (from Status Dashboard)

### DOING (Active Work)
1. **Tooling** - Production Pipeline: Docker + CI/CD + health checks
2. **Dashboard** - Live Data Integration: Remove USE_MOCK_DATA; wire MCP
3. **MCP** - Production Monitoring: Rate limit/retry; error tracking

### Quality Observations
- Dashboard blocker (:8080) likely related to Tooling containerization work
- Dashboard on critical path for "Live Data Integration"
- Blocker may be expected during active development

## Recommendations

### Immediate (P1)
1. **Dashboard Team**: Verify service status on port 8080
   - Check if dashboard dev server is running
   - Confirm port binding configuration
   - Reference: Tooling production pipeline work may be affecting this

### Short-term (P2)
2. **Approvals/Assistants**: Verify SSE endpoint path
   - Check if `/assistants/events` is correct path
   - May be `/api/assistants/events` or different route
   - Impact: SSE streaming feature gated until resolved

### Low Priority (P3)
3. **RAG Team**: Fix Docker healthcheck
   - Service is healthy but Docker reports unhealthy
   - Review healthcheck configuration in docker-compose.yml
   - Non-blocking; cosmetic issue

## Proof-of-Work Compliance

**Status**: ✅ CLEARED

**Evidence**:
- Manager update poll: 18:00 UTC
- Service health validation: 18:01-18:02 UTC
- Blocker confirmation: 18:01-18:02 UTC
- Coordination note: This file
- Feedback log: feedback/quality.md updated

## Next Actions

### For Quality Agent
1. ✅ Proof-of-work logged (this validation)
2. ✅ Blockers confirmed and documented
3. 📋 Resume 5-minute polling cadence
4. 📋 Offer support to Dashboard/Approvals if needed
5. 📋 Monitor critical path progress

### For Dashboard Team
- Investigate port 8080 service status
- May be related to ongoing containerization work (Tooling)
- Coordinate with Tooling on production pipeline integration

### For Approvals/Assistants Team
- Verify SSE endpoint path
- Low impact; feature gated when unavailable
- Can proceed with other work

## Summary

**Health Status**: 2 healthy, 2 blocked, 1 false positive  
**New Findings**: Confirmed both 16:54Z integration blockers  
**Critical Path Impact**: Dashboard blocker may be expected during active dev  
**Quality Agent**: Proof-of-work cleared, resuming continuous work protocol
