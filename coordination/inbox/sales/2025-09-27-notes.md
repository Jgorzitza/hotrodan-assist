# 2025-09-27 Sales Agent Notes

## Next
- Track Data-layer contract handoff and prep to toggle `USE_MOCK_DATA` once the live service URL lands.

## Log
- 2025-10-10 — Normalized loader/action range boundaries to YYYY-MM-DD before hitting the analytics adapter, updated Vitest expectations, and re-ran `npm exec vitest run app/routes/__tests__/app.sales.test.ts` (warning logs from intentional fetch failure remain expected).
- 2025-10-08 — Loader switched to `fetchSalesAnalyticsWithCache` with fixture fallback; no schema gaps flagged.
- 2025-10-08 — `npm exec vitest run app/routes/__tests__/app.sales.test.ts` (passes, seccomp WebSocket warning expected).
- 2025-10-08 — `npm exec vitest run app/lib/sales/__tests__/analytics.server.test.ts` (passes, seccomp WebSocket warning expected).

## 2025-09-27 Sales Analytics UI Integration
- **Status**: Completed integration of latest Shopify analytics response shape and fixtures from Data layer
- **Analytics Integration**: 
  - Verified existing `analyticsSalesFixtures` in `dashboard/app/mocks/fixtures/analytics.sales.ts` are up-to-date with Data layer contract
  - Confirmed `mapAnalyticsResponse` function in `analytics.server.ts` properly handles both snake_case and camelCase field variations
  - Loader already uses `fetchSalesAnalyticsWithCache` with proper fallback to fixtures when live service unavailable
- **Test Results**:
  - Sales Vitest suite (`app/routes/__tests__/app.sales.test.ts`) with `USE_MOCK_DATA=false`: **5/5 tests passed**
  - Analytics server tests (`app/lib/sales/__tests__/analytics.server.test.ts`): **4/4 tests passed**
  - All tests completed in ~4.8s with expected warning logs from intentional fetch failures
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Polaris Viz upgrade remains deferred as per program manager directive
  - Current table/summary UI maintained for MVP
  - Range boundaries properly normalized to YYYY-MM-DD format before hitting analytics adapter
  - Fixture fallback working correctly when analytics service unavailable
- **No Blockers**: All integration work completed successfully, ready for live service handoff when Data layer publishes contract
