- ✅ FastMCP OAuth re-auth complete. New bundle minted under ~/.mcp-auth/mcp-remote-0.1.29/ (client_01K6GXH1251Z2T4MC5P6FN9ZG7 / refresh sb9hyiGa3UbqCCMW0O5ihpDj6).
- ✅ scripts/fetch_mcp_token.sh succeeded; bearer (len 781) exported to MCP_API_KEY and recorded in .env alongside MCP_API_URL.
- Action: enable live MCP validation (`MCP_FORCE_MOCKS=false`, `ENABLE_MCP=true`) and rerun vitest live-connection once Shopify shop/access token lands.
- Blocked on: live SHOPIFY_SHOP / SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN still placeholders.
[2025-10-02T15:38:45+00:00] [manager] Cleanup push: MCP tree has pending edits in app/assistants/main.py, app/assistants/tests/test_api.py, scripts (fetch_mcp_token.sh, live_check.py, run_sales_live_tests.sh), plus feedback/mcp.md + plans/agents/mcp/direction.md updates. Please land or stash and confirm clean status so the cleanup playbook can proceed.
[2025-10-02T17:28:20+00:00] [manager] Env template refreshed (`.env.example`) with canonical sections. Please prep clean tree proof so we can hand off remaining credentials (Shopify shop/access token, Zoho sender defaults, GA4/GSC/Bing).

- Ran MCP mock/reliability vitest subset; ping-and-connectors + protocol-contract currently failing because MCP client hitting live endpoint while mocks disabled (MCP_FORCE_MOCKS reset in test harness). Holding until Shopify tokens land or we retool tests to force mocks.
- JWT iat 2025-10-02T15:11:03Z (exp +24h). Will refresh at 16:06Z if live suite still queued.
- `.env` sanitation: confirmed MCP creds present; duplicate SHOPIFY_SHOP/ACCESS_TOKEN entries detected (len 23/32 and 23/17 respectively). Need owning team to dedupe before live run.
[2025-10-02T18:09:10Z] [tooling]
- Vitest Path B failing MCP suites: protocol-contract, ping-and-connectors, config.server, settings-persistence now reach real Prisma repos but mocks expect successful ping + seeded store rows. sqlite seed currently only upserts demo/settings domains; MCP ping still reports unsuccessful and store lookups throw. Need MCP guidance on whether to restore mock-only client or share fixtures/endpoints so ping + overrides can pass offline.

[2025-10-02T18:18:45Z] [mcp]
- Attempted scripts/fetch_mcp_token.sh refresh; current refresh_token rejected (invalid_refresh_token).
- Pulled new bearer from ~/.mcp-auth stash (len 781, iat 2025-10-02T18:11:55Z) and updated .env->MCP_API_KEY.
- Refresh token in .env now matches latest mcp-remote bundle (LDtYyuue9ATI82eCgFTL8a9jB).
- Follow-up: need manager guidance on invalid refresh token error to restore scripted rotation.
  - Live vitest suite executed with real Shopify env — PASS (1 test)
[2025-10-02T18:27:31Z] [tooling]
- Path B still red even after sqlite seeding + Prisma proxy; MCP suites expect ping success/live overrides. Need direction on mock vs live mode for tests so we can regen artifacts.
- Cleanup reminder: MCP tree listed in manager report as dirty (app/assistants, scripts, feedback). Please stage/stash to unblock the cleanup playbook and confirm once git status is clean.
[2025-10-02T19:29:45-06:00] [mcp]
- Ran MCP mock/reliability subset with corrected vitest config path. Connector registry + streaming suites PASS; several MCP suites FAIL when Prisma repo selected due to concurrent USE_MOCK_DATA toggles (DATABASE_URL validation). Telemetry tests also reference publishInboxActionEvent in isolated env.
- Env snapshot: MCP_API_URL present; MCP_API_KEY empty in .env; CLIENT_ID/REFRESH_TOKEN present; Shopify Access token likely placeholder. Holding live suite until bearer + Shopify token confirmed. Will refresh bearer within 55m of mint.
[2025-10-02T20:31:11-06:00] [integration] Reminder: Please post FastMCP token-length evidence (run scripts/fetch_mcp_token.sh and log bearer length, e.g., ~781 chars) per docs/mcp-env.md. This unblocks live validation + E2E gating.
