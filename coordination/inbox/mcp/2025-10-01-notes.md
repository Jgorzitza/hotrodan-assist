## 2025-10-01T08:49:40Z — Settings persistence + telemetry validation
- Added tests for MCP settings overrides (mock + Prisma) — passing
- Added telemetry counters test and end-to-end SSE test — passing
- Metrics route (/__dev.mcp.metrics) ready for scrape in non-prod
- Bench script scaffolded at dashboard/scripts/bench_mcp.ts

## 2025-10-01T08:27:40Z — Client hardening, tests, docs
- Added Zod validation + sanitization for MCP responses (schema.server.ts)
- Respect Retry-After for 429; optional in-memory LRU cache with TTL
- Added version/feature headers (X-MCP-Client-Version, X-MCP-Features)
- New tests: headers-and-url, ping-and-connectors — all MCP tests passing
- Docs added: docs/mcp-api.md, docs/mcp-env.md, docs/mcp-architecture.md, docs/mcp-disaster-recovery.md
- Next: finalize remaining docs and acceptance checklist; avoid non-MCP suite blockers

## 2025-10-01T01:21:50-06:00 — Focus + next actions
- GO-SIGNAL.md not present; polling direction only for now.
- Proceeding on mcp.enterprise-platform per direction.
- Next: install dashboard deps, run MCP integration tests with mocks, record results, optional live validation if creds provided.
- Validation targets: dashboard/app/lib/mcp/__tests__/*.test.ts and dashboard/app/lib/settings/__tests__/connection-tests.test.ts.
- 5-minute polling active via nohup (poll2.log).

## 2025-10-01T01:22:30-06:00 — Baseline MCP tests
- Env: ENABLE_MCP=true, USE_MOCK_DATA=true, MCP_FORCE_MOCKS=true
- Exit code: 0

## 2025-10-01T07:42:10Z — Baseline validation (mock mode)
- Executed vitest suite for MCP client and settings connection tests
- Command: USE_MOCK_DATA=true ENABLE_MCP=true MCP_FORCE_MOCKS=true npx vitest run --root dashboard --config vitest.config.ts dashboard/app/lib/mcp/__tests__/*.test.ts dashboard/app/lib/settings/__tests__/connection-tests.test.ts
- Result: 4 test files, 17 tests — all passed
- GO-SIGNAL.md still missing; continuing with direction-only cadence and logging
- Next up: implement rate limiting, circuit breaker, connection pooling; add telemetry/metrics per connector; define SLO thresholds

## 2025-10-01T08:07:10Z — Reliability features added
- MCP client now includes: concurrency limiting, RPS rate limiting, jittered retries, circuit breaker, keep-alive pooling (undici Agent when present)
- Telemetry hooks extended: onRateLimitDelay, onBreakerOpen/HalfOpen/Close
- Tests: MCP client suite (5 tests) passing; connection-tests also passing. config.server.test may require prisma generate in CI; will resolve separately
- Commands:
  - npx vitest run --root dashboard --config vitest.config.ts dashboard/app/lib/mcp/__tests__/client.server.test.ts
  - npx vitest run --root dashboard --config vitest.config.ts dashboard/app/lib/mcp/__tests__/*.test.ts dashboard/app/lib/settings/__tests__/connection-tests.test.ts (intermittent failure on config.server.test due to Prisma) 

## 2025-10-01T08:18:00Z — Connector registry, streaming, metrics, containerization
- Connector management foundation shipped with typed config + CRUD + health checks; telemetry hooks in place
- Streaming substrate (in-memory) with retry/backoff and DLQ; tests cover DLQ and transient retry paths
- Metrics route exported (/app/metrics) + initial SLOs and runbook docs; route secured in prod
- Containerization (dashboard/Dockerfile) + docker-compose; K8s manifests deploy/k8s/
- CI workflow added to run typecheck and all tests with prisma generate best-effort
- Full dashboard suite (targeted modules): passing; route-level flake observed unrelated to MCP paths; triage scheduled

## 2025-10-01T08:20:40Z — Security & secrets; non-functional validation; coordination
- Secrets adapter integrated into settings repository; audits recorded for secret changes and MCP overrides; masked values only; tests added
- Validation added for MCP secret (>=8 chars, no whitespace); tests pass
- Non-functional: streaming throughput sanity test added (50 msgs in <500ms locally)
- Risks: a subset of route tests timing out in CI env; not MCP-related; owners (Dashboard) flagged in status dashboard; suggested increasing test timeout or optimizing loaders
- Next check-in: 15 minutes; continue MCP protocol/registry integration tests and finalize handoff

## 2025-10-01T08:25:45Z — MCP protocol/registry contracts
- Default connector registry integration added; contract tests validate ping(mock), required connectors present, and health-check path
- Result: protocol-contract tests passed (3)
- Proceeding to final handoff unless Manager requests more capabilities

## 2025-10-01T08:15:30Z — Telemetry + connectors wiring
- Added MCP telemetry publisher (dashboard/app/lib/mcp/telemetry.server.ts) producing SSE events via inbox stream
- Extended InboxActionEventType to include mcp:* events; no impact to existing consumers
- Wired telemetry into real MCP client in getMcpClient; mocks unchanged
- Implemented connector status API (dashboard/app/lib/mcp/connectors.server.ts): list + ping with per-shop overrides, logs connection test
- Validated MCP tests still pass: client + index suites ✓
- Wider dashboard tests currently fail due to missing root dev deps (jsdom et al.) unrelated to MCP; kept scope to MCP per task focus
- Next: expose connector status in settings UI once approved
