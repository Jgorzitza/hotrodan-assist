# 2025-09-27 Approval Agent Notes

## Next
- Once service creds/env vars are ready, rerun `npx vitest run` from the `dashboard/` workspace to validate connection health + SSE smoke coverage, and log telemetry results here.
- Prepare the Assistants provider feature-flag rollout checklist (steps, toggles, tests) while waiting on credentials.
- After rerun, confirm connection telemetry endpoints log attempts/open/error/offline events and document findings in this note.

## Log
- 2025-09-27: Surfaced Assistants bridge status via SSE handshake/events, updated the inbox indicator/toasts to reflect provider outages, and added coverage with `npx vitest run app/routes/__tests__/app.inbox.connection.test.tsx app/routes/__tests__/app.inbox.stream.test.ts`.
- 2025-09-27: Added inbox stream smoke asserting the handshake goes offline when `ASSISTANTS_SERVICE_URL` is missing so the UI surfaces provider misconfigurations.
