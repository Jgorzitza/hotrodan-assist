# Settings Agent Feedback Log

Use this file to suggest changes to `prompts/dashboard/route-settings.md`. Do **not** edit the master prompt without approval.

## 2025-09-27 Program Manager Directive
- Immediate focus: finish loader/action integration coverage using shared Prisma fixtures, keep scope to thresholds/toggles/credential persistence for MVP, document (donâ€™t implement) KMS/audit plans.
- Log requests with rationale, dependencies, and test updates here for review.

## 2025-09-27 Settings Agent Note
- Added KMS migration + audit logging TODOs and Prisma dependency callout to `prompts/dashboard/route-settings.md`; confirmed Vitest suites (`app.settings`, Prisma integration) green on 2025-09-27.
- Waiting on Data-layer credential bundle and shared fixtures before expanding Status/Immediate Focus again.
