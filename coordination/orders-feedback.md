- Scope remains: finish wiring live Sync write APIs (payload schema v1.2), extend Vitest coverage for assign/fulfill/support/returns, partner with Inventory on blocker thresholds.
- Any new proposal (e.g., additional helpers, alternate focus) must be logged here with rationale and test plan for review.
- Unauthorized edits to master prompts or `agents.md` will be reverted.
