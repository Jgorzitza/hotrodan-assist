## Immediate Actions (Critical Path)

CEO Directive ‚Äî Production Today (2025-10-01)

  2) CEO Dependencies ‚Äî Today
  3) Manager and Integration notes (coordination/inbox/manager|integration/2025-10-01-notes.md)
- Continue executing current tasks; log progress in feedback/<agent>.md and coordination/inbox/<agent>/<date>-notes.md
1) Tooling ‚Äî Production Pipeline (DOING)
   - Containerize services; CI/CD; health checks; monitoring/alerts
2) Dashboard ‚Äî Live Data Integration (DOING)

## Polling Commands (run every 5 minutes)
```bash
ls -la coordination/GO-SIGNAL.md coordination/AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md || true
head -40 plans/agents/[your-agent]/direction.md || true
```

## Report Progress
- Append to feedback/[your-agent].md every 5 minutes with proof-of-work (diff/test/artifact) or blocker + fallback started.
- If blocked, state the blocker and proceed with fallback tasks from your direction file.

## Compliance Enforcement
- If no proof-of-work appears in feedback within 10 minutes, the cycle is marked non-compliant and escalated in blockers-log.
- Continuous work is mandatory: pick the next task immediately from ‚ÄúNext 5 Tasks‚Äù in your direction.
- Automation: A scheduled monitor (Agent Proof Monitor) runs every 5 minutes to enforce proof-of-work and append escalations automatically.
