## Report Progress
- Append to feedback/[your-agent].md every 5 minutes with proof-of-work (diff/test/artifact) or blocker + fallback started.

## Compliance Enforcement
- If no proof-of-work appears in feedback within 10 minutes, the cycle is marked non-compliant and escalated in blockers-log.

- Automation: A scheduled monitor (Agent Proof Monitor) runs every 5 minutes to enforce proof-of-work and append escalations automatically.
