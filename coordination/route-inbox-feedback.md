## 2025-09-27 Program Manager Directive
- Immediate focus: ship the Assistants provider feature flag + AiDraft persistence once credentials arrive, extend Vitest coverage for the connection health indicator/offline banner, and report EventSource reliability findings for telemetry.
- Record future suggestions here with rationale, dependencies, and test impact. The Program Manager will review before updating the master prompt.
