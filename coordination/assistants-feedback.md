# Assistants Agent Feedback Log

Use this file to request scope changes for the Assistants/Settings data-layer work. Do **not** modify `prompts/dashboard/data-layer.md` or related docs directly.

## 2025-09-27 Program Manager Directive
- Immediate focus: deliver Prisma-backed repository support (fixtures, withStoreSession wiring) once Data-layer contract lands, and defer retention/KMS implementation until post-MVP (documentation only).
- Log proposed changes, dependencies, and test impact here for review.
