# Feedback Directory Guidelines

Use one canonical file per agent:
- feedback/dashboard.md
- feedback/approvals.md
- feedback/seo.md
- feedback/rag.md
- feedback/inventory.md
- feedback/sales.md
- feedback/mcp.md
- feedback/tooling.md
- feedback/quality.md
- feedback/manager.md

Archive specialized reports under  and reference them in the canonical file with a dated header.

Quality agent must not change files outside .
To temporarily allow, stage  in the same commit.
