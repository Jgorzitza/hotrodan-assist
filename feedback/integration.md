# Integration Manager Feedback Log

(Use the template in `templates/feedback-template.md`. Append proof-of-work every 5 minutes: commands run, outputs, blockers, next actions.)

## 2025-10-01T15:54:46-06:00

## 2025-10-01T21:33:02-06:00
- Smoke log `artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T21:33:02-06:00-smoke.log`

- Continuing health sweep cadence; will rerun smoke post-fix.

## 2025-10-01T21:53:13-06:00
- `bash scripts/health_grid.sh | tee artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T21:53:18-06:00-health-grid.tsv` → all endpoints 200 (dashboard metrics, RAG, etc.).
- `python3 scripts/monitor_agents.py` → exit 0.
- Action: relayed manager directive—agents must reread GO-SIGNAL, AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS, their direction, and manager notes, then log focus updates before continuing primary tasks.

- Compliance check 21:55 MDT: Dashboard/Inventory/MCP/RAG/Sales logged focus updates; Tooling, SEO, Approvals pending — reminders sent in their inbox notes.
## 2025-10-01T21:59:19-06:00
- `bash scripts/health_grid.sh | tee artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T21:59:19-06:00-health-grid.tsv`

- Actions: updating status dashboard + blockers, paging RAG, tracking pending focus updates from Tooling/SEO/Approvals.

- Follow-ups sent to MCP/Inventory/Approvals with fresh curl 404 evidence; manager notified, awaiting fixes before next smoke rerun.
## 2025-10-01T22:09:25-06:00
- `bash scripts/health_grid.sh | tee artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T22:09:30-06:00-health-grid.tsv`
  - RAG `/health` + `/prometheus` 000 (connection reset); others 200.

- `bash scripts/health_grid.sh | tee artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T22:11:39-06:00-health-grid.tsv` → all endpoints 200 (RAG recovered).
- `python3 scripts/live_check.py` snapshot stored in tmp/live_check.out showing 200s across checks.
- Closed RAG blocker and updating readiness; still tracking `/api/mcp/health`, `/api/inventory/health`, `/assistants/events` 404s.

- Artifact audit: `test-results/dashboard/` empty as of 22:12 MDT; nudged Tooling for upload evidence.
- Metrics check: `curl -si http://localhost:8080/app/metrics` → 200 but Content-Length 0; will raise with Dashboard after smoke blockers clear.

- `python3 scripts/monitor_agents.py` → exit 0.
- Monitoring outstanding smoke blockers (MCP/Inventory/Approvals 404s) + pending focus updates (SEO, Approvals).

- RAG metrics summary: requests_total=42, rate_limited=0, GC collected gen0/1/2 = 3113/422/46 (tmp/prometheus_snapshot.prom, 22:15 MDT).
- Published metrics snapshot summary: artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T22-15-00-metrics-summary.txt (includes health sweep, RAG metrics, `/app/metrics` empty-body note, smoke blockers).
- Confirmed `which python` still empty (python shim unresolved); continuing to rely on python3 fallback.
- Reminded Inventory that smoke curl targets :8080 (current curl hitting :3000 returns 000); waiting on route wiring confirmation.
## 2025-10-01T22:20:20-06:00
- `bash scripts/health_grid.sh | tee artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T22:20:28-06:00-health-grid.tsv`
  - RAG `/health` + `/prometheus` back to 000 (connection reset).
- `python3 scripts/monitor_agents.py` → exit 0.
- Actions: re-paged RAG with artifact, reopening blocker; continuing sweeps.

- `python3 scripts/live_check.py` now failing with ConnectionResetError 104 (tmp/live_check.out) — consistent with RAG flapping; awaiting fix.

- Status dashboard refreshed for MCP row (04:20Z) noting `/api/mcp/health` still 404 during smoke despite telemetry updates.
- Verified Path B artifacts present: test-results/dashboard/vitest-junit.xml and eslint-junit.xml (22:14 MDT).
- SEO still pending directive acknowledgement; escalated reminder at 22:24 MDT.
## 2025-10-01T22:25:24-06:00
- `bash scripts/health_grid.sh | tee artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T22:25:33-06:00-health-grid.tsv`
  - `/app/metrics` timed out → 000; RAG `/health` + `/prometheus` still 000 (connection reset).
- `python3 scripts/monitor_agents.py` → exit 0.
- Actions: re-pinging Dashboard + RAG, blockers updated; smoke remains blocked.

- Alerted Dashboard (metrics timeout) and RAG (continued connection resets) with 22:25 MDT artifact; blockers updated accordingly.
- Manual retry curl showed `/app/metrics` 200 (empty body) at 22:28 MDT; keeping blocker until sweeps stabilize alongside route fixes.
- Outstanding blockers @22:29 MDT logged in integration notes (metrics timeout, MCP/Inventory/Approvals 404s, RAG flapping, SEO/Approvals focus compliance).
## 2025-10-01T22:29:30-06:00
- `bash scripts/health_grid.sh | tee artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T22:29:39-06:00-health-grid.tsv` → all services 200.
- `python3 scripts/monitor_agents.py` → exit 0.
- RAG stabilized for now; keeping dashboard metrics blocker open until consistent + 404s resolved.

- RAG health blocker closed (22:29 MDT) following recovery; requested root-cause notes from team.
- Live check rerun succeeded (tmp/live_check.out) after RAG recovery.
- Provided Dashboard/MCP with build manifest evidence that `/api/mcp/health` isn’t compiled (likely route naming mismatch `app/routes/api.mcp.health.ts` vs directory form).
- Alerted Inventory: build manifest missing `/api/inventory/health`; recommended switching to dot-route naming so endpoint mounts at :8080.
- Added compliance blockers in blockers-log for missing SEO & Approvals directive acknowledgements.
## 2025-10-01T22:34:54-06:00
- `bash scripts/health_grid.sh | tee artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T22:35:01-06:00-health-grid.tsv` → all endpoints 200.
- `python3 scripts/monitor_agents.py` → exit 0.
- Waiting on Dashboard/MCP/Inventory/Approvals for route fixes + SEO/Approvals for compliance updates.

- Produced rolling health summary table (artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T22-35-rolling-health.txt) for dashboard metrics & RAG stability tracking.
- Approvals SSE still 404 on verification (22:37 MDT); requested proof of fix despite restart note.

## 2025-10-01T22:39:17-06:00
- `bash scripts/health_grid.sh | tee artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T22:39:25-06:00-health-grid.tsv` → all endpoints 200.
- `python3 scripts/monitor_agents.py` → exit 0.
- Continuing to chase Dashboard/MCP/Inventory/Approvals blockers + compliance tasks.

- Shared explicit dot-route naming guidance with Dashboard/Inventory so `/api/mcp/health` & `/api/inventory/health` compile into build manifest.
- Maintained readiness checklist in integration notes (dashboard metrics+routes, MCP/Inventory/Approvals endpoints, compliance, smoke rerun prep).
- Inventory status updated on dashboard (04:30Z) referencing manifest gap for `/api/inventory/health`.
- Status dashboard Tooling row refreshed: instructions now use python3 for monitor; tracking artifact verification.

- `python3 scripts/monitor_agents.py` → exit 0.
- Standing by for route/SSE/compliance fixes to re-run smoke.

- Staged smoke rerun command (documented in integration notes) ready for execution once routes/SSE fixed.
- Created readiness snapshot document (artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T22-50-readiness.md).
- Sent Dashboard shell snippet to rename route to `app/routes/api.mcp.health.ts` and request curl proof post-fix.
