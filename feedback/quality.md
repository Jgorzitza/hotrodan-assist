## Next Sprint (Quality) - 2025-09-29T09:01:44-06:00
- Status: Planned
- Owner: Quality Engineer
- Note: Non-feedback edits require staging feedback/QUALITY_ALLOW_CODE_CHANGES in the same commit.
- Kickoff: Reliability guardrails + SLOs

### Backlog (Top Priority)
1) Contract/e2e suites for top flows
2) Synthetic monitoring for critical paths
3) Accessibility audits and fixes (axe)
4) Security checks (SAST/DAST) integrated
5) Load and soak tests with thresholds
6) Flaky test auto-retry classification
7) Error budget policy + SLO dashboards
8) Incident playbooks and simulations
9) Cross-browser/device matrix in CI
10) Test result triage dashboard

> Process: Use canonical feedback/quality.md for all updates. Non-canonical files are archived.
