# Feedback (agent â†’ manager)
- Agent: Inventory Engineer
- Sprint: 2025-10-01
- What I just finished:
  - Inventory route tests are green (6/6).
- What I propose next (ranked):
  1) Document p95 latency target and profiling plan for 1000+ SKUs (impact: perf readiness, est: 1h)
  2) Add CSV export test skeleton for pagination (impact: data ops, est: 45m)
  3) Health endpoint verification and monitor hook (impact: prod checks, est: 45m)
- What I need:
  - None for mock mode; will request Shopify live creds when wiring starts.
- Risks/observations:
  - CI dev-deps missing for UI tests (manager dashboard notes) â€” tooling to provision.

- What I just finished (cont.):
  - Inventory health endpoint implemented + test PASS
  - p95 target & measurement plan documented
- Next cycle:
  - CSV export pagination test skeleton (it.skip placeholder)
  - Health monitor hook to scrape /api/inventory/health

- Proof-of-work:
  - CSV export test skeleton added (skipped)
  - Targeted vitest run completed without failures
- Next cycle:
  - Implement mock CSV export route and add unskipped assertions

- Proof-of-work (2025-10-02T08:32:48-06:00): Targeted vitest run (inventory suite) PASS â€” 2 files, 4 tests; health curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/inventory/health returned 404 (endpoint likely misnamed); next step is to inspect Remix route naming to restore 200 response.
- Proof-of-work (2025-10-02T08:36:00-06:00): Renamed inventory API routes to flat Remix form (`api.inventory.health.ts`, `api.inventory.export.csv.ts`), fixed imports, and reran targeted vitest (PASS). Curl still 404 pending dev server restart.
- Proof-of-work (2025-10-02T08:39:31-06:00): `npx remix routes` confirms `/api/inventory/*` endpoints registered after rename; `npm run build` currently blocked by existing `useNonce` import issue in dashboard/app/root.tsx â€” flagged for follow-up; curl pending dev server restart.

- Proof-of-work (2025-10-02T11:24:39-06:00): Stabilized inventory perf harness (warm-ups + timeout tweaks) and re-ran vitest â€” p95 inventory_generation â‰ˆ 102ms, csv_export â‰ˆ 3.85ms; documented results in docs/inventory-performance.md.
- Proof-of-work (2025-10-02T12:22:11-06:00): Ran live-mode vitest bundle with ENABLE_MCP=true / MCP_FORCE_MOCKS=false using fm8vte-ex.myshopify.com credentials â€” 5 files, 13 tests PASS; inventory_generation p95 â‰ˆ 46.6ms, csv_export p95 â‰ˆ 5.6ms.
- Proof-of-work (2025-10-02T13:43:39-06:00): Manager noted MCP refresh token failure; acknowledged dependency and waiting on updated credentials before re-enabling automation.

- Proof-of-work (2025-10-03T19:29Z): Targeted vitest (inventory) PASS â€” 3 files, 9 tests; added stub `dashboard/app/lib/inventory/live.server.ts` to satisfy live import without network I/O.
- Proof-of-work (2025-10-03T19:29Z): curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/inventory/health â†’ HTTP 000 (dev server offline); validated health via loader tests instead.
- Blocking note (2025-10-03T19:29Z): Live Shopify wiring readiness = BLOCKED (credentials + dev server availability). Will re-run curl upon server/tunnel availability.

- Proof-of-work (2025-10-03T20:12Z): Re-ran targeted vitest with dashboard config â€” PASS (3 files, 9 tests). Suites: api.inventory.health, api.inventory.csv-export.loader, app.inventory.
- Proof-of-work (2025-10-03T20:12Z): curl /api/inventory/health â†’ HTTP 000 (server offline); recorded fallback and command in coordination/inbox/inventory/2025-10-03-notes.md.
- Status (2025-10-03T20:12Z): p95 target remains â‰¤400ms; measurement plan tracked in docs/inventory-performance.md; perf harness ready for mock dataset runs.
 - Proof-of-work: Targeted vitest (inventory) PASS â€” 3 files, 9 tests; curl /api/inventory/health pre/post: HTTP 000 (dev server offline). Evidence logged under `coordination/inbox/inventory/2025-10-03-notes.md`.
 - Perf harness plan: Use mock dataset generator (1.2k SKUs) via `/api/inventory/export.csv` pagination to measure p95 over batches; capture p50/p95/error% to `docs/inventory-performance.md` and attach CSV artifacts under `artifacts/phase3/inventory/`.
