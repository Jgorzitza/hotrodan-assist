# Feedback (agent → manager)
- Agent: Inventory Engineer
- Sprint: 2025-10-01
- What I just finished:
  - Inventory route tests are green (6/6).
- What I propose next (ranked):
  1) Document p95 latency target and profiling plan for 1000+ SKUs (impact: perf readiness, est: 1h)
  2) Add CSV export test skeleton for pagination (impact: data ops, est: 45m)
  3) Health endpoint verification and monitor hook (impact: prod checks, est: 45m)
- What I need:
  - None for mock mode; will request Shopify live creds when wiring starts.
- Risks/observations:
  - CI dev-deps missing for UI tests (manager dashboard notes) — tooling to provision.

- What I just finished (cont.):
  - Inventory health endpoint implemented + test PASS
  - p95 target & measurement plan documented
- Next cycle:
  - CSV export pagination test skeleton (it.skip placeholder)
  - Health monitor hook to scrape /api/inventory/health
