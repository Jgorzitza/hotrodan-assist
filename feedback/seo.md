## 2025-10-01 – Advanced Analytics Platform: Execution Log

- Role: SEO & Content Intelligence Engineer
- Direction: plans/agents/seo/direction.md → NEXT TASK: seo.advanced-analytics-platform (GO signal active)
- Repo: /home/justin/llama_rag

Environment
- Node/npm: v22.19.0 / 11.6.1
- Install (dashboard): OK

Validation runs
- Lint (dashboard): non-zero (unrelated areas). SEO UI change compiles; will clean up broader lint issues separately per direction.
- Typecheck (root): PASSED
- Targeted SEO tests: PASSED
  - app/routes/__tests__/app.seo.loader.test.ts
  - app/routes/__tests__/api.seo.report.test.ts
  - app/routes/__tests__/api.seo.keywords.test.ts
  - app/lib/seo/__tests__/persistence.server.test.ts
- Full dashboard suite: previously PASSED; will re-run after next batch of changes.

Latest changes (08:46Z)
- UI: Added Refresh health button on SEO page; confirms live connection-tests visibility.
- Lint: Fixed unused adapter variable in settings repository; scoped lint now clean for changed files.
- Tests: Targeted SEO suites still PASS after changes.

Credentials status (BLOCKERS for live)
- GA4: GA4_PROPERTY_ID, GA4_CLIENT_ID, GA4_CLIENT_SECRET, GA4_REFRESH_TOKEN — missing
- GSC: GSC_CLIENT_ID, GSC_CLIENT_SECRET, GSC_REFRESH_TOKEN — missing
- Bing: BING_CLIENT_ID, BING_CLIENT_SECRET, BING_REFRESH_TOKEN — missing
- MCP: MCP_API_URL, MCP_API_KEY (optional: MCP_MAX_RETRIES, MCP_TIMEOUT_MS) — missing
- Mode: Mock-first until provided; helper scripts ready: add_ga4_credentials.sh, add_gsc_credentials.sh, add_bing_credentials.sh

Changes landed
- SEO UI: Added credentials gating banner when no providers connected; existing mock-state banner retained. Live connection health badges visible and sourced from /api/seo/health. Adapters are gated via Settings connection status and disabled accordingly.
- API routes: MCP overlay retained (feature-gated; mock-first) in report endpoint; keywords/pages/actions unaffected.
- Tests: Fixed app.seo loader test module resolution and stubbed heavy UI libs to avoid timeouts; all targeted suites pass.
- Notes files updated:
  - coordination/inbox/integration/2025-10-01-notes.md (status, blockers, next steps)

Next actions
1) Optional: consider MCP advisory integration for optimize-content endpoint
2) Ensure persistence behavior continues to align with advanced analytics action lifecycle
3) Surface adapter/MCP health (connection-tests) prominently on SEO UI — DONE (live health badges + gating banner)
4) Add credentials gating banner when no live providers are connected — DONE (critical banner with Settings guidance)
5) Iterate with lint/typecheck/targeted tests; then run broader suite

Polling
- Five-minute polling active; logs in coordination/inbox/seo/2025-10-01-poll.log
