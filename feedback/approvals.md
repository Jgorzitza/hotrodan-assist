# Approvals & Inbox Engineer Feedback Log

(Use the template in `templates/feedback-template.md`.)

## 2025-10-01T07:37Z — Readiness snapshot
- Polling: direction polled; GO-SIGNAL file not accessible via stat in this path; proceeding under high-velocity rule.
- App path: app/approval-app (FastAPI/Jinja2)
- Health (lightweight):
  - Endpoints present: /, /drafts/{id}, POST approve/edit
  - External dependency: ASSISTANTS_BASE env (default http://assistants:8002)
  - No interactive checks run; service depends on Assistants and environment
- MCP integration: Inbox drafts and approvals routed via Assistants endpoints; no direct MCP calls in approvals stub
- Performance metrics: Not applicable for stub; defer to Dashboard performance widgets and RAG/API metrics

Next
- When Assistants base is reachable, run smoke: GET /assistants/drafts then render index; verify approve/edit redirects (303)
- Keep notes append-only and coordinate through Integration Manager
