# Approvals Feedback

## Auto-Approval Configuration Request

### Problem
Currently requiring manual approval for all agent actions is time-consuming and slows down development workflow.

### Proposed Solution
Implement auto-approval rules based on:

1. **Action Risk Levels**
   - Auto-approve: READ operations, data queries, report generation
   - Manual approval: WRITE operations, database changes, external API calls

2. **Agent Trust Levels**
   - High trust: Auto-approve all actions from trusted agents
   - Medium trust: Auto-approve low-risk actions only
   - Low trust: Manual approval for all actions

3. **Time-based Rules**
   - Auto-approve during business hours
   - Auto-approve for non-critical changes
   - Manual approval for production deployments

### Implementation
- Add `auto_approval_rules.json` configuration
- Implement confidence scoring for agent actions
- Add batch approval for similar actions
- Create approval delegation system

### Benefits
- Faster development cycle
- Reduced manual overhead
- Maintains safety through risk-based rules
- Allows focus on high-value decisions
