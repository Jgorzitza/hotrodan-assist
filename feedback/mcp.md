## Next Sprint (MCP) - 2025-09-29T09:01:44-06:00
- Status: Planned
- Owner: MCP Engineer
- Kickoff: Contracts + observability

### Backlog (Top Priority)
1) Service registry with health and versions
2) Typed contracts + schema registry
3) Retry/backoff and DLQ for failed events
4) Idempotent handlers; exactly-once where feasible
5) OAuth secrets rotation and vault integration
6) Rate limiting and circuit breakers
7) Traces/metrics/logs correlation (OTel)
8) Contract tests against mocks
9) Backfill/replay tooling with guardrails
10) Canary deploy and traffic shifting

> Process: Use canonical feedback/mcp.md for all updates. Non-canonical files are archived.
