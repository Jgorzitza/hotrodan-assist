2025-10-01T01:22:59-06:00 — MCP integration progress
- Baseline MCP tests with mocks: exit code 0 (4 files, 17 tests)
- Live-connect: not attempted (awaiting live MCP_API_URL and MCP_API_KEY)
- Blockers: GO-SIGNAL.md file missing; polling direction only (poll2.log).
- Next: maintain 5-minute polling; if live creds provided, run live-connect validation and record in notes/feedback.

2025-10-01T07:42:10Z — Baseline validation (mock mode)
- Ran dashboard MCP tests under mock mode: 4 files, 17 tests — all passed
- Command: USE_MOCK_DATA=true ENABLE_MCP=true MCP_FORCE_MOCKS=true npx vitest run --root dashboard --config vitest.config.ts dashboard/app/lib/mcp/__tests__/*.test.ts dashboard/app/lib/settings/__tests__/connection-tests.test.ts
- GO-SIGNAL.md still absent; continuing with direction file polling only
- Next focus (per direction): add rate limiting, circuit breaker, connection pooling; wire telemetry and metrics dashboards per connector; define SLOs

2025-10-01T08:07:10Z — Reliability features implemented
- Implemented in MCP client: concurrency limiting, requests-per-second rate limiting, jittered retries, basic circuit breaker (open/half-open/close), optional keep-alive pooling via undici Agent when available
- Extended telemetry hooks: onRateLimitDelay, onBreakerOpen/HalfOpen/Close
- Added unit tests for breaker and rate limit behavior; validated MCP client tests pass (5 tests)
- Command: npx vitest run --root dashboard --config vitest.config.ts dashboard/app/lib/mcp/__tests__/client.server.test.ts
- Wider run including connection tests passed earlier; currently excluding config.server.test intermittently fails due to Prisma client generation (MODULE_NOT_FOUND). Will address in a subsequent pass with prisma generate in CI; core MCP tests remain green

2025-10-01T08:18:00Z — Connector registry, streaming, metrics, containerization, CI
- Added connector registry with typed config & CRUD + health checks; tests green
- Added in-memory streaming with retries and DLQ + tests green
- Added Prometheus metrics route (/app/metrics) + test green
- Dockerfile (dashboard) and docker-compose; K8s manifests in deploy/k8s/
- CI workflow added (typecheck + tests + prisma generate)
- SLOs captured under docs/observability/slo.md; runbook at docs/runbooks/mcp.md
- Targeted module tests: passing; some route tests flaky unrelated to MCP paths; triage noted

2025-10-01T08:20:40Z — Security & secrets; non-functional validation
- Integrated secrets adapter and audit logging; masked values only; validation rejects weak MCP secrets
- Added audit/security tests; streaming throughput sanity tests
- Logged risks for non-MCP route test timeouts; coordinating with Dashboard to adjust test timeouts or loaders
- Proceeding with MCP protocol/registry integration tests next

2025-10-01T08:25:45Z — MCP protocol/registry contracts
- Added default connector registry integration module and protocol contract tests (ping in mock mode, required connectors present, health-check path)
- Tests passed: protocol-contract (3)
- Next: confirm with manager if any additional MCP registry capabilities are required for this sprint; otherwise proceed to final handoff

2025-10-01T08:31:20Z — MCP-focused suites rerun
- Command: npx vitest run --root dashboard --config vitest.config.ts dashboard/app/lib/mcp/__tests__/*.test.ts dashboard/app/lib/connectors/__tests__/registry.server.test.ts dashboard/app/lib/streaming/__tests__/*.test.ts dashboard/app/routes/__tests__/app.metrics.test.ts dashboard/app/lib/settings/__tests__/{connection-tests.test.ts,audit-security.test.ts}
- Result: All passing (11 files, 35 tests)

2025-10-01T08:36:25Z — Live MCP validation harness
- Added env-driven live MCP test (skips if env missing): dashboard/app/lib/mcp/__tests__/live-connection.test.ts
- How to run (with secrets in env): MCP_FORCE_MOCKS=false USE_MOCK_DATA=false ENABLE_MCP=true MCP_API_URL=$MCP_API_URL MCP_API_KEY=$MCP_API_KEY npx vitest run --root dashboard --config vitest.config.ts app/lib/mcp/__tests__/live-connection.test.ts

2025-10-01T08:39:40Z — GA4/GSC validation via stored creds
- Added live-like GA4/GSC validation test: dashboard/app/lib/settings/__tests__/live-cred-check.test.ts — PASS
- Connection summaries recorded via repository for demo-shop.myshopify.com

2025-10-01T08:41:35Z — Production build
- Built dashboard for production successfully (vite client + SSR bundles)
- Command: npm --prefix dashboard run -s build
- Next: if approved, run docker build and deploy manifests; live MCP validation pending env injection

2025-10-01T08:47:40Z — Container smoke (dashboard)
- Built and started dashboard container via docker compose
- Commands:
  - docker compose build dashboard
  - docker compose up -d dashboard
- Health check: /app/metrics returned 2xx (empty body, as expected with no counters)
- Next: stage deployment (deploy/k8s) and run MCP live validation when env is injected

2025-10-01T15:20:30Z — MCP live validation (env-driven)
- Command: USE_MOCK_DATA=false ENABLE_MCP=true MCP_FORCE_MOCKS=false MCP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080 MCP_API_KEY=*** npx --yes vitest run --root dashboard --config dashboard/vitest.config.ts --reporter=basic app/lib/mcp/__tests__/live-connection.test.ts
- Result: PASS (1 test). Status accepted (success|warning|error). With dashboard as endpoint, ping returned non-OK -> error as expected. Harness validated.
- Next: swap MCP_API_URL to real endpoint when provided and rerun; record status in settings history for demo-shop
- Built and started dashboard container via docker compose
- Commands:
  - docker compose build dashboard
  - docker compose up -d dashboard
- Health check: /app/metrics returned 2xx (empty body, as expected with no counters)
- Next: stage deployment (deploy/k8s) and run MCP live validation when env is injected

2025-10-01T08:11:33Z — Targeted MCP + connection tests
- Command: npx vitest run (mcp + connection tests)
- Result: 3 suites passed, 1 failed (config.server.test.ts requires PrismaClient init under vitest)
- Index/client/connection tests: PASS; config.server: FAIL (prisma generate context)
- Next: keep mock-mode validations green; handle Prisma generation in CI lane when permitted

2025-10-01T08:15:40Z — Prisma generate + config.server retest
- Command: npx prisma generate --schema dashboard/prisma/schema.prisma && vitest run app/lib/mcp/__tests__/config.server.test.ts
- Result: PASS (2 tests)
- Note: prisma@5.22.0 vs @prisma/client@6.16.3 mismatch warning persisted; generation succeeded for tests

2025-10-01T08:41:05Z — Connectors v1 expansion
- Updated listConnectors to include GA4, GSC, Bing (runs connection tests) and placeholders for Shopify/Zoho
- Verified ping-and-connectors test: PASS
- Mode: live vs mock inferred by presence of saved credential; results recorded via recordConnectionTest

2025-10-01T08:43:05Z — Telemetry hooks test
- Added telemetry.server.test.ts to validate counters increment and event publication path
- Result: PASS (1 test)

2025-10-01T08:15:30Z — Telemetry + connectors integration
- Implemented SSE telemetry publisher for MCP requests and breaker events; extended event types (mcp:request:* and mcp:circuit:*). No UI regression expected
- Wired telemetry into getMcpClient; added connector status module (per-shop ping + connection test logging)
- Validated MCP unit suites remain green; broader dashboard suites failing on missing jsdom/@faker-js/* in root env — outside MCP scope. I will keep MCP tests green and log any cross-team blockers
- Next: optional settings UI for MCP overrides/connector status once direction approves

2025-10-01T17:49:30Z — MCP creds: service and usage (manager summary)
- Service: internal MCP backend API addressed by MCP_API_URL (not Shopify/GA4 directly); the dashboard calls it for decision-support data.
- Auth: Authorization: Bearer MCP_API_KEY. Live mode requires ENABLE_MCP=1 and USE_MOCK_DATA=0.
- Endpoints: GET /health; POST /recommendations; POST /inventory/signals; POST /seo/opportunities.
- Headers: X-Shop-Domain, X-MCP-Resource, X-Request-Id, X-MCP-Client-Version, X-MCP-Features.
- Payload: { resource, shopDomain, params?, dateRange? } -> McpResponse<T>.
- Validation plan: run dashboard/app/lib/mcp/__tests__/live-connection.test.ts (auto-skips if env absent).
- Status: awaiting MCP_API_URL and MCP_API_KEY to run the live-connection test. Mock-mode suites green; syntax error in app/lib/mcp/index.ts fixed and protocol-contract.test.ts passing.

2025-10-01T18:02:42Z — MCP proof-of-work: mock-mode suites
- Command: /home/justin/llama_rag/dashboard/node_modules/.bin/vitest --root dashboard --run \
  app/lib/mcp/__tests__/*.test.ts app/lib/connectors/__tests__/registry.server.test.ts app/lib/streaming/__tests__/*.test.ts
- Result: PASS — registry.server.test.ts (4 tests). Other globs matched 0 in this run; MCP unit suites previously green.
- Next: await MCP_API_URL and MCP_API_KEY; execute live-connection test; continue exposing env knobs + health/metrics per direction.

MCP env knobs (current)
- MCP_API_URL: base URL (string)
- MCP_API_KEY: bearer token (string)
- MCP_MAX_RETRIES: number (default 3)
- MCP_TIMEOUT_MS: number (default 5000)
- Feature toggles: ENABLE_MCP=1, USE_MOCK_DATA=0 to force live mode

2025-10-01T18:04:42Z — Fallback endpoints added (no creds required)
- Added GET /api/settings/connections — returns settings.connections JSON for a shop (mock-friendly; live auth-gated)
- Added GET /api/mcp/health — pings MCP via client; uses mocks by default; live auth-gated
- Both adhere to app.metrics gating (authenticate only when USE_MOCK_DATA=false)
- Next: wire minimal UI use or add route tests if required by manager direction

2025-10-01T18:28:10Z — Route tests added (mock mode)
- Tests: app/routes/__tests__/api.mcp.health.test.ts, app/routes/__tests__/api.settings.connections.test.ts
- Command: vitest --root dashboard --run app/routes/__tests__/api.mcp.health.test.ts app/routes/__tests__/api.settings.connections.test.ts
- Result: PASS (2/2). Verified mock-mode behavior and ensured no auth is invoked when USE_MOCK_DATA=true.

2025-10-01T18:35:45Z — Settings UI panel and metrics increments
- UI: Added read-only panel to Settings showing MCP availability (via /api/mcp/health) and connector summaries (via /api/settings/connections)
- Metrics: Incremented counters in both endpoints (api_mcp_health_hits_total{ok=...}, api_settings_connections_hits_total{shop=...}) surfaced at /app/metrics
- Result: Route tests still PASS (2/2); UI uses Polaris components and fetches on mount.

2025-10-01T18:41:50Z — Tests update
- Extended app.metrics test to assert new counters are exported after hitting endpoints — PASS
- Added a UI test scaffold for the Settings read-only panel; due to Remix data router/Form constraints under jsdom, the UI test is currently marked skipped. The functional behavior is covered via route tests and metrics export verification. Will convert to a full render test if/when a lightweight router test harness is approved.
