## Next Sprint (RAG) - 2025-09-29T09:01:44-06:00
- Status: Planned
- Owner: RAG Engineer
- Kickoff: Hybrid retrieval + eval harness

### Backlog (Top Priority)
1) Document pipeline: dedupe, semantic chunking, TOC-aware splits
2) Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense) with re-ranking
3) Freshness and recency decay strategies
4) Safe responses: policy filters + citation enforcement
5) Vector store compaction + orphan cleanup
6) Query telemetry and feedback loop (thumbs up/down)
7) Evaluation harness with golden sets and KPIs
8) Multi-tenant index isolation and quotas
9) Metadata governance (PII redaction)
10) Cost dashboard for embedding/LLM spend
