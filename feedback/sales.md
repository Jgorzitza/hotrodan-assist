   - Bing: Mock-mode only (credential pending)
   - Test command: ENABLE_MCP=true USE_MOCK_DATA=true vitest run

2. **CLV & Forecast Scaffolds**: Documented approach
   - CLV calculation framework planned
   - Forecast models: Scaffold structure defined
   - SLO definitions: Ready for drafting

3. **CSV Export**: Test baseline prepared

3. Define SLOs for sales analytics endpoints
4. Add CSV export tests
5. Document findings

---
**[20:30 UTC] Proof-of-Work ‚Äî sales.mock-validation**
- Ran sales + metrics tests in mock mode:
  - Command: `ENABLE_MCP=true MCP_FORCE_MOCKS=true npx vitest run --root dashboard --config vitest.config.ts app/routes/__tests__/app.sales.test.ts`
  - Results: 1 file, 5 tests ‚Äî PASS
  - Command: `ENABLE_MCP=true MCP_FORCE_MOCKS=true npx vitest run --root dashboard --config vitest.config.ts "dashboard/app/routes/__tests__/app.metrics.test.ts"`
  - Results: 1 file, 2 tests ‚Äî PASS
- Curl metrics after tests to verify counters:
  - Command: `curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\\n' http://127.0.0.1:8080/app/metrics || true`
  - HTTP code: 000 (no local server running)
- MCP credentials present in `.env` (MCP_API_URL, MCP_CLIENT_ID, MCP_REFRESH_TOKEN); continuing with `MCP_FORCE_MOCKS=true` until Shopify Admin token arrives.
- Bing remains in mock-mode pending credentials (only if referenced by Sales).

**SLO Candidates (mock-mode placeholders)**
- Availability: ‚â• 99.0% (route `GET /app/sales`, `GET /app/metrics`)
- Error rate: ‚â§ 1.0% (5xx from sales loader/action)
- p95 route latency: ‚â§ 1800 ms (sales loader, CSV action)

Artifacts: vitest outputs captured above; metrics curl code recorded.
Blocked: no running app server for `/app/metrics` curl, and Shopify Admin token not yet provided for live MCP-backed path. Proceeding to next molecule (CLV/forecast scaffolds) while mocks remain enabled.
