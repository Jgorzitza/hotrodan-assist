# Release Operations Helper Feedback Log

(Template: timestamped proof-of-work, checklist status, blockers, next actions every 5 minutes.)

## 2025-10-01T15:58:36-06:00
- Read GO-SIGNAL + agent instructions; direction confirmed.
- `ls playbooks` → missing directory; blocking First Action 1. Preparing escalation and selecting fallback task (checklist compilation).
- `git status -sb` captured current repo changes for readiness ledger.
- Next: log blocker in `coordination/blockers-log.md`, gather existing checklist evidence from coordination inboxes.
## 2025-10-01T16:01:11-06:00
- Evidence sweep: collected latest notes/feedback for dashboard, tooling, MCP, integration, SEO, inventory, approvals.
- Health grid (`artifacts/phase3/integration/2025-10-01T15:54:04-06:00-health-grid.tsv`) → `/app/metrics` still 000; Integration smoke blocked.
- Credentials: GA4/GSC validated (per `feedback/seo.md`), Bing pending; MCP_API_URL/MCP_API_KEY still missing for live validation.
- Actions queued: build release-readiness checklist in inbox, escalate `/app/metrics` urgency with dashboard/tooling, capture credential ownership reminders.
## 2025-10-01T16:03:36-06:00
- Posted release-readiness table + credentials watch in inbox; flagged Dashboard metrics outage, Tooling shim gap, MCP/Sales work outstanding.
- Drafted GO/NO-GO outline → current call NO-GO pending `/app/metrics` 200, UI lane artifacts, Bing + MCP creds, Integration smoke rerun.
- Documented rollback steps (rollout undo / docker compose fallback + mock-mode toggles + health checks) for rapid response if production degrades.
- Next: chase owners for GO prerequisites (Dashboard tunnel/metrics ETA, Tooling shim + artifact upload, credential handoff) and prepare CEO-facing summary.
## 2025-10-01T16:16:16-06:00
- Proof: `curl -s -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8080/app/metrics` → 000 (connection refused); dashboard metrics outage persists.
- Logged tooling blocker: added `scripts/monitor_agents.py` python shim requirement to `coordination/blockers-log.md` with Tooling owner.
- Credentials: no new Bing/MCP secrets delivered; keeping CEO dependency status ⏳.
- Next: compile owner ping summary (Dashboard metrics + tunnel, Tooling shim + UI lane artifacts, MCP live validation, credential ETA) and update GO/NO-GO when responses land.
## 2025-10-01T20:35:15-06:00
- Logged owner outreach summary in inbox: outlined asks for Dashboard (metrics + tunnel evidence), Tooling (python shim, UI lane, CI artifacts), MCP (live validation plan), and Manager (Bing/MCP credentials timeline).
- Plan to monitor respective feedback logs next cycle; will escalate in blockers-log if owners silent for >10 minutes.
- Next: Await acknowledgements; ready to update GO/NO-GO matrix and credential watch on receipt.
## 2025-10-01T20:40:23-06:00
- Manager briefed via `coordination/inbox/manager/2025-10-01-release-ops-update.md` with readiness summary, blockers (metrics outage, python shim, missing playbooks), and outstanding asks.
- Logged action in release-ops notes; continuing to poll dashboard/tooling/mcp/credentials feedback for responses.
- Next: escalate in blockers-log if no owner acknowledgment by 20:50 MDT.
## 2025-10-01T20:55:31-06:00
- Ran FastMCP bootstrap command (`npx -y mcp-remote@latest https://tired-green-ladybug.fastmcp.app/mcp`) per direction update; connection established and closed.
- Exported client/refresh vars via jq and executed `scripts/fetch_mcp_token.sh`; received `invalid_refresh_token` (HTTP 400) so token length 0 (no secret stored).
- Planning escalation: add blocker entry for invalid FastMCP refresh token and request new credentials from Manager/Credentials owner.
## 2025-10-01T21:19:40-06:00
- Adopted new fallback queue; executed fallback (a) audit CI artifacts. Findings: `test-results/` contains only quality logs; no dashboard vitest/eslint artifacts yet. `artifacts/phase3` populated mainly with quality reports.
- Recorded inventory agent’s curl result (HTTP 000 with dev server offline) while tests remain green; flagged need to rerun once tunnel/live server is up.
- Still awaiting refreshed FastMCP token; next fallback planned (GO/NO-GO evidence refresh) if credentials stay blocked.
## 2025-10-01T21:26:55-06:00
- Processed manager intel: latest integration health grid shows dashboard metrics and RAG health endpoints returning 000. Added RAG service-health blocker with artifact link.
- Tooling Path B note claims new dashboard artifacts under `test-results/dashboard/`, but local check still shows only quality logs; flagged for confirmation.
- Next fallback per queue: refresh GO/NO-GO evidence table to include new RAG blocker and awaiting credentials.
## 2025-10-01T21:32:16-06:00
- Refreshed release readiness table: Dashboard and RAG both BLOCKED (health grid 20:41:57), MCP now marked BLOCKED (invalid refresh token), Tooling AT RISK pending python shim/artifact upload. Inventory/Approvals remain GREEN; SEO partial; Sales TODO.
- GO/NO-GO reaffirmed NO-GO with added prerequisite for RAG health restoration.
- Monitoring credential blockers (MCP/Bing) and awaiting owner responses next cycle.
## 2025-10-01T21:42:20-06:00
- Manager updates reviewed: integration health grid (20:41:57) shows dashboard `/app/metrics` 000 and RAG `/health`/`/prometheus` 000 → logged RAG service-health blocker (coordination/blockers-log.md:4266).
- Documented MCP credential storage plan (1Password item “FastMCP OAuth – Tired Green Ladybug”) in release notes; awaiting refreshed refresh token to clear FastMCP blocker.
- Tooling note claims dashboard Path B artifacts in `test-results/dashboard/`, but local audit still missing them; will follow up with Tooling next cycle alongside dashboard/RAG remediation requests.
## 2025-10-01T21:47:05-06:00
- Compliance check: re-read GO-SIGNAL, AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS, release-ops direction, and manager notes; logged focus update in coordination inbox.
- Continuing primary task: keep GO/NO-GO readiness up to date and chase owners on dashboard/RAG outages, MCP credentials, Tooling shim/artifacts.
- Secondary fallback queued: refresh blockers-log timestamps and validate docs/mcp-env.md once credential handoff lands.
## 2025-10-01T21:53:21-06:00
- Health grid 21:30 shows dashboard + RAG back to 200; logged closure entry for prior RAG outage.
- Integration smoke at 21:33 surfaced new 404s (`/api/mcp/health`, `/api/inventory/health`, `/assistants/events`); added blockers for Dashboard, Inventory, Approvals and updated readiness snapshot (tracks now AT RISK/BLOCKED as appropriate).
- Next actions: ping owners on new blockers, chase Tooling for python shim/artifact uploads, coordinate with Manager for refreshed FastMCP secrets.
## 2025-10-01T21:58:17-06:00
- Notified Dashboard, Inventory, Approvals about 404 smoke blockers (curl evidence requested) and Tooling about missing python shim/Path B artifacts.
- Blocker refs: coordination/blockers-log.md:4268–4270, 4264.
- Monitoring their inboxes/feedback next cycle for remediation updates.
## 2025-10-01T21:56:27-06:00
- Logged blocker follow-ups (dashboard/inventory/approvals 404s, tooling shim/artifact gap) with current timestamp in coordination/blockers-log.md.
- Awaiting owner responses; ready to move to next fallback once updates arrive.
## 2025-10-01T21:59:20-06:00
- Fallback queue item (d) complete: spot-checked docs/mcp-env.md; instructions already align with manager’s FastMCP auth expectations (npx bootstrap + 1Password storage). No doc changes required until new secrets arrive.
- Continuing to watch dashboard/inventory/approvals/tooling channels for remediation evidence.
## 2025-10-01T22:05:10-06:00
- Drafted release notes section summarizing scope, highlights awaiting GO evidence, active risks, and missing proof (Dashboard/Inventory/Approvals 404 fixes, Tooling artifacts, FastMCP token refresh) in `coordination/inbox/release-ops/2025-10-01-notes.md`.
- Continuing to monitor owner channels while building documentation for GO/NO-GO packet.
## 2025-10-01T22:12:44-06:00

- Awaiting dashboard/inventory/approvals/tooling/rag/mcp credential updates.
## 2025-10-01T22:23:34-06:00
- Manual curl check shows RAG `/health` and `/prometheus` now 200; keeping blocker open until RAG posts goldens/metrics evidence.
- Monitoring feedback/rag.md for confirmation before clearing.
## 2025-10-01T22:28:33-06:00
- RAG posted goldens + live_check PASS at 22:12 MDT; closed service-health blocker and marked RAG GREEN in readiness snapshot.

## 2025-10-01T22:35:12-06:00
- Documented blocker timeline (smoke 404s, RAG regression/recovery, follow-up pings) to support morning GO review.
- Remaining blockers unchanged: waiting on Dashboard/Inventory/Approvals fixes, Tooling shim/artifacts, FastMCP + Bing creds.
## 2025-10-01T22:40:27-06:00
- Drafted morning brief summary covering NO-GO posture, resolved items (RAG), outstanding evidence, and next actions.
- Will refine as owner responses land overnight.
## 2025-10-01T22:45:09-06:00
- Confirmed smoke blockers still reproducible manually (API MCP/Inventory health endpoints + Approvals SSE all returning 404). Awaiting owner fixes.
## 2025-10-01T22:50:12-06:00
- Recorded approvals SSE soak artifact path (`artifacts/phase3/approvals/sse-soak-20251002T031337Z.json`) in readiness notes; still need `/assistants/events` 200 to clear blocker.
## 2025-10-01T22:55:41-06:00
- Expanded rollback plan in release notes covering dashboard/inventory/approvals/RAG/MCP/tooling toggles for quick reversion if tonight’s deploy regresses.
## 2025-10-01T23:00:52-06:00
- Captured owner status snapshot (last proof-of-work per team); highlights Dashboard/Inventory/Approvals still silent on 404 blockers, Tooling confirmation pending.
## 2025-10-01T23:05:33-06:00
- Confirmed new Tooling artifacts (`test-results/dashboard/vitest-junit.xml`, `eslint-junit.xml`). Still need python shim output to close blocker.
